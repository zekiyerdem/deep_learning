The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.\\n\\nIn the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second\\nquarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the\\nname of Canty, who did not want him. \\xa0On the same day another English\\nchild was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.\\nAll England wanted him too. \\xa0England had so longed for him, and hoped\\nfor him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the\\npeople went nearly mad for joy. \\xa0Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed\\neach other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich\\nand poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they\\nkept this up for days and nights together. \\xa0By day, London was a sight\\nto see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and\\nsplendid pageants marching along. \\xa0By night, it was again a sight\\nto see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of\\nrevellers making merry around them. \\xa0There was no talk in all England\\nbut of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in\\nsilks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that\\ngreat lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not\\ncaring, either. \\xa0But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty,\\nlapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had\\njust come to trouble with his presence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. Tom’s early life.\\n\\nLet us skip a number of years.\\n\\nLondon was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that\\nday. It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.\\n\\xa0The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the\\npart where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. \\xa0The\\nhouses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first,\\nand the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. \\xa0The higher\\nthe houses grew, the broader they grew. \\xa0They were skeletons of strong\\ncriss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.\\n\\xa0The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner’s\\ntaste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. \\xa0The windows\\nwere small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened\\noutward, on hinges, like doors.\\n\\nThe house which Tom’s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called\\nOffal Court, out of Pudding Lane. \\xa0It was small, decayed, and rickety,\\nbut it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty’s tribe\\noccupied a room on the third floor. \\xa0The mother and father had a sort of\\nbedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,\\nBet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,\\nand might sleep where they chose. \\xa0There were the remains of a blanket\\nor two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not\\nrightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked\\ninto a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at\\nnight, for service.\\n\\nBet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins. \\xa0They were good-hearted\\ngirls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant. \\xa0Their mother\\nwas like them. \\xa0But the father and the grandmother were a couple of\\nfiends. \\xa0They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other\\nor anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk\\nor sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. \\xa0They made\\nbeggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them. \\xa0Among,\\nbut not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old\\npriest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of\\na few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them\\nright ways secretly. Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and\\nhow to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls,\\nbut they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have\\nendured such a queer accomplishment in them.\\n\\nAll Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty’s house.\\nDrunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and\\nnearly all night long. \\xa0Broken heads were as common as hunger in that\\nplace. \\xa0Yet little Tom was not unhappy. \\xa0He had a hard time of it, but\\ndid not know it. \\xa0It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys\\nhad, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.\\n\\xa0When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would\\ncurse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful\\ngrandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away\\nin the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any\\nmiserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going\\nhungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of\\ntreason and soundly beaten for it by her husband.\\n\\nNo, Tom’s life went along well enough, especially in summer. \\xa0He only\\nbegged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were\\nstringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time\\nlistening to good Father Andrew’s charming old tales and legends\\nabout giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and\\ngorgeous kings and princes. \\xa0His head grew to be full of these wonderful\\nthings, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and\\noffensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he\\nunleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in\\ndelicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince\\nin a regal palace. \\xa0One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:\\n\\xa0it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes. \\xa0He spoke of it once to\\nsome of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so\\nunmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.\\n\\nHe often read the priest’s old books and got him to explain and enlarge\\nupon them. \\xa0His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,\\nby-and-by. \\xa0His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his\\nshabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.\\n\\xa0He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but,\\ninstead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it,\\nhe began to find an added value in it because of the washings and\\ncleansings it afforded.\\n\\nTom could always find something going on around the Maypole in\\nCheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London\\nhad a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was\\ncarried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer’s day he saw\\npoor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and\\nheard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.\\nYes, Tom’s life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.\\n\\nBy-and-by Tom’s reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a\\nstrong effect upon him that he began to _act_ the prince, unconsciously.\\nHis speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the\\nvast admiration and amusement of his intimates. \\xa0But Tom’s influence\\namong these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he\\ncame to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a\\nsuperior being. \\xa0He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such\\nmarvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise! \\xa0Tom’s remarks,\\nand Tom’s performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and\\nthese, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him\\nas a most gifted and extraordinary creature. \\xa0Full-grown people brought\\ntheir perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the\\nwit and wisdom of his decisions. \\xa0In fact he was become a hero to all\\nwho knew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.\\n\\nPrivately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! \\xa0He was the\\nprince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords\\nand ladies in waiting, and the royal family. \\xa0Daily the mock prince was\\nreceived with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic\\nreadings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed\\nin the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his\\nimaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.\\n\\nAfter which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat\\nhis poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch\\nhimself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs\\nin his dreams.\\n\\nAnd still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,\\ngrew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed\\nall other desires, and became the one passion of his life.\\n\\nOne January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up\\nand down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour\\nafter hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and\\nlonging for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed\\nthere--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,\\njudging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to\\nown and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was\\nmurky; it was a melancholy day. \\xa0At night Tom reached home so wet and\\ntired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother\\nto observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;\\nwherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.\\n\\xa0For a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting\\ngoing on in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts\\ndrifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company\\nof jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had\\nservants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders. \\xa0And\\nthen, as usual, he dreamed that _he_ was a princeling himself.\\n\\nAll night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved\\namong great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,\\ndrinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of\\nthe glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a\\nsmile, and there a nod of his princely head.\\n\\nAnd when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness\\nabout him, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the\\nsordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold. \\xa0Then came bitterness,\\nand heart-break, and tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. Tom’s meeting with the Prince.\\n\\nTom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy\\nwith the shadowy splendours of his night’s dreams. He wandered here\\nand there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what\\nwas happening around him. \\xa0People jostled him, and some gave him rough\\nspeech; but it was all lost on the musing boy. \\xa0By-and-by he found\\nhimself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in\\nthat direction. \\xa0He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his\\nimaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London. \\xa0The Strand\\nhad ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,\\nbut by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably\\ncompact row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered\\ngreat buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with\\nample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are\\nnow closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.\\n\\nTom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the\\nbeautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then\\nidled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal’s\\nstately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace\\nbeyond--Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of\\nmasonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and turrets,\\nthe huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its magnificent array\\nof colossal granite lions, and other the signs and symbols of English\\nroyalty. \\xa0Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last? \\xa0Here,\\nindeed, was a king’s palace. \\xa0Might he not hope to see a prince now--a\\nprince of flesh and blood, if Heaven were willing?\\n\\nAt each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say,\\nan erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel\\nin shining steel armour. \\xa0At a respectful distance were many country\\nfolk, and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of\\nroyalty that might offer. \\xa0Splendid carriages, with splendid people\\nin them and splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by\\nseveral other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.\\n\\nPoor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and\\ntimidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when\\nall at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that\\nalmost made him shout for joy. \\xa0Within was a comely boy, tanned and\\nbrown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all\\nof lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little\\njewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;\\nand on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened\\nwith a great sparkling gem. \\xa0Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his\\nservants, without a doubt. \\xa0Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living\\nprince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer\\nof the pauper-boy’s heart was answered at last.\\n\\nTom’s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big\\nwith wonder and delight. \\xa0Everything gave way in his mind instantly\\nto one desire: \\xa0that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,\\ndevouring look at him. \\xa0Before he knew what he was about, he had his\\nface against the gate-bars. \\xa0The next instant one of the soldiers\\nsnatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd\\nof country gawks and London idlers. \\xa0The soldier said,--\\n\\n“Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!”\\n\\nThe crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate\\nwith his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried\\nout,--\\n\\n“How dar’st thou use a poor lad like that? \\xa0How dar’st thou use the King\\nmy father’s meanest subject so? \\xa0Open the gates, and let him in!”\\n\\nYou should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then.\\nYou should have heard them cheer, and shout, “Long live the Prince of\\nWales!”\\n\\nThe soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates,\\nand presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his\\nfluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.\\n\\nEdward Tudor said--\\n\\n“Thou lookest tired and hungry: \\xa0thou’st been treated ill. \\xa0Come with\\nme.”\\n\\nHalf a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don’t know what; interfere,\\nno doubt. \\xa0But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and\\nthey stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues. \\xa0Edward\\ntook Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.\\n\\xa0By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered\\nbefore except in books. \\xa0The prince, with princely delicacy and\\nbreeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be\\nembarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked\\nquestions while Tom ate.\\n\\n“What is thy name, lad?”\\n\\n“Tom Canty, an’ it please thee, sir.”\\n\\n“‘Tis an odd one. \\xa0Where dost live?”\\n\\n“In the city, please thee, sir. \\xa0Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.”\\n\\n“Offal Court! \\xa0Truly ’tis another odd one. \\xa0Hast parents?”\\n\\n“Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently\\nprecious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin\\nsisters, Nan and Bet.”\\n\\n“Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?”\\n\\n“Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. \\xa0She hath a wicked\\nheart, and worketh evil all her days.”\\n\\n“Doth she mistreat thee?”\\n\\n“There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with\\ndrink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to\\nme with goodly beatings.”\\n\\nA fierce look came into the little prince’s eyes, and he cried out--\\n\\n“What! \\xa0Beatings?”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.”\\n\\n“_Beatings_!--and thou so frail and little. \\xa0Hark ye: \\xa0before the night\\ncome, she shall hie her to the Tower. \\xa0The King my father”--\\n\\n“In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. \\xa0The Tower is for the great\\nalone.”\\n\\n“True, indeed. \\xa0I had not thought of that. \\xa0I will consider of her\\npunishment. \\xa0Is thy father kind to thee?”\\n\\n“Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”\\n\\n“Fathers be alike, mayhap. \\xa0Mine hath not a doll’s temper. \\xa0He smiteth\\nwith a heavy hand, yet spareth me: \\xa0he spareth me not always with his\\ntongue, though, sooth to say. \\xa0How doth thy mother use thee?”\\n\\n“She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.\\nAnd Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”\\n\\n“How old be these?”\\n\\n“Fifteen, an’ it please you, sir.”\\n\\n“The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey,\\nmy cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but\\nmy sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you: \\xa0do thy\\nsisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their\\nsouls?”\\n\\n“They? \\xa0Oh, dost think, sir, that _they_ have servants?”\\n\\nThe little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then\\nsaid--\\n\\n“And prithee, why not? \\xa0Who helpeth them undress at night? \\xa0Who attireth\\nthem when they rise?”\\n\\n“None, sir. \\xa0Would’st have them take off their garment, and sleep\\nwithout--like the beasts?”\\n\\n“Their garment! \\xa0Have they but one?”\\n\\n“Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more? \\xa0Truly they have\\nnot two bodies each.”\\n\\n“It is a quaint and marvellous thought! \\xa0Thy pardon, I had not meant\\nto laugh. \\xa0But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys\\nenow, and that soon, too: \\xa0my cofferer shall look to it. \\xa0No, thank me\\nnot; ’tis nothing. \\xa0Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.\\n\\xa0Art learned?”\\n\\n“I know not if I am or not, sir. \\xa0The good priest that is called Father\\nAndrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.”\\n\\n“Know’st thou the Latin?”\\n\\n“But scantly, sir, I doubt.”\\n\\n“Learn it, lad:  ’tis hard only at first. \\xa0The Greek is harder; but\\nneither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady\\nElizabeth and my cousin. \\xa0Thou should’st hear those damsels at it! \\xa0But\\ntell me of thy Offal Court. \\xa0Hast thou a pleasant life there?”\\n\\n“In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There\\nbe Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so\\nbravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout\\nand fight till all are slain, and ’tis so fine to see, and costeth but\\na farthing--albeit ’tis main hard to get the farthing, please your\\nworship.”\\n\\n“Tell me more.”\\n\\n“We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,\\nlike to the fashion of the ‘prentices, sometimes.”\\n\\nThe prince’s eyes flashed. \\xa0Said he--\\n\\n“Marry, that would not I mislike. \\xa0Tell me more.”\\n\\n“We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.”\\n\\n“That would I like also. \\xa0Speak on.”\\n\\n“In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and\\neach doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and\\nshout and tumble and--”\\n\\n“‘Twould be worth my father’s kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go\\non.”\\n\\n“We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,\\neach covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh\\nthe lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the\\nworld!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship’s\\npresence.”\\n\\n“Oh, prithee, say no more, ’tis glorious! \\xa0If that I could but clothe me\\nin raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,\\njust once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego\\nthe crown!”\\n\\n“And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just\\nonce--”\\n\\n“Oho, would’st like it? \\xa0Then so shall it be. \\xa0Doff thy rags, and don\\nthese splendours, lad! \\xa0It is a brief happiness, but will be not less\\nkeen for that. \\xa0We will have it while we may, and change again before\\nany come to molest.”\\n\\nA few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom’s\\nfluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked\\nout in the gaudy plumage of royalty. \\xa0The two went and stood side by\\nside before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to\\nhave been any change made! \\xa0They stared at each other, then at the\\nglass, then at each other again. \\xa0At last the puzzled princeling said--\\n\\n“What dost thou make of this?”\\n\\n“Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. \\xa0It is not meet that\\none of my degree should utter the thing.”\\n\\n“Then will _I_ utter it. \\xa0Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the\\nsame voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and\\ncountenance that I bear. \\xa0Fared we forth naked, there is none could\\nsay which was you, and which the Prince of Wales. \\xa0And, now that I\\nam clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more\\nnearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not\\nthis a bruise upon your hand?”\\n\\n“Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor\\nman-at-arms--”\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0It was a shameful thing and a cruel!” cried the little prince,\\nstamping his bare foot.  “If the King--Stir not a step till I come\\nagain! It is a command!”\\n\\nIn a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national\\nimportance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying\\nthrough the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and\\nglowing eyes. \\xa0As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,\\nand tried to shake them, shouting--\\n\\n“Open! \\xa0Unbar the gates!”\\n\\nThe soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince\\nburst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier\\nfetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the\\nroadway, and said--\\n\\n“Take that, thou beggar’s spawn, for what thou got’st me from his\\nHighness!”\\n\\nThe crowd roared with laughter. \\xa0The prince picked himself out of the\\nmud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--\\n\\n“I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for\\nlaying thy hand upon me!”\\n\\nThe soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--\\n\\n“I salute your gracious Highness.” \\xa0Then angrily--“Be off, thou crazy\\nrubbish!”\\n\\nHere the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled\\nhim far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--\\n\\n“Way for his Royal Highness! \\xa0Way for the Prince of Wales!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. The Prince’s troubles begin.\\n\\nAfter hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was\\nat last deserted by the rabble and left to himself. \\xa0As long as he had\\nbeen able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and\\nroyally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very\\nentertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was\\nno longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.\\nHe looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality. \\xa0He\\nwas within the city of London--that was all he knew. \\xa0He moved on,\\naimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by\\nwere infrequent. \\xa0He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed\\nthen where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed\\non, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered\\nhouses in it, and a prodigious church. \\xa0He recognised this church.\\n\\xa0Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was\\nundergoing elaborate repairs. \\xa0The prince took heart at once--he felt\\nthat his troubles were at an end, now. \\xa0He said to himself, “It is the\\nancient Grey Friars’ Church, which the king my father hath taken from\\nthe monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children,\\nand new-named it Christ’s Church. \\xa0Right gladly will they serve the son\\nof him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son\\nis himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this\\nday, or ever shall be.”\\n\\nHe was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,\\nplaying at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and\\nright noisily, too. \\xa0They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion\\nwhich in that day prevailed among serving-men and ‘prentices{1}--that\\nis to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the\\nsize of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such\\nscanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair\\nfell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight\\naround; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely\\nand hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt;\\nbright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large\\nmetal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.\\n\\nThe boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with\\nnative dignity--\\n\\n“Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth\\nspeech with him.”\\n\\nA great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--\\n\\n“Marry, art thou his grace’s messenger, beggar?”\\n\\nThe prince’s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his\\nhip, but there was nothing there. \\xa0There was a storm of laughter, and\\none boy said--\\n\\n“Didst mark that? \\xa0He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince\\nhimself.”\\n\\nThis sally brought more laughter. \\xa0Poor Edward drew himself up proudly\\nand said--\\n\\n“I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my\\nfather’s bounty to use me so.”\\n\\nThis was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. \\xa0The youth who had\\nfirst spoken, shouted to his comrades--\\n\\n“Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace’s princely father, where be\\nyour manners? \\xa0Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to\\nhis kingly port and royal rags!”\\n\\nWith boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did\\nmock homage to their prey. \\xa0The prince spurned the nearest boy with his\\nfoot, and said fiercely--\\n\\n“Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!”\\n\\nAh, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun. \\xa0The laughter\\nceased on the instant, and fury took its place. \\xa0A dozen shouted--\\n\\n“Hale him forth! \\xa0To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond! \\xa0Where be the\\ndogs? \\xa0Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!”\\n\\nThen followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred\\nperson of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and\\nset upon and torn by dogs.\\n\\nAs night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in\\nthe close-built portion of the city. \\xa0His body was bruised, his hands\\nwere bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud. \\xa0He wandered\\non and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint\\nhe could hardly drag one foot after the other. \\xa0He had ceased to ask\\nquestions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of\\ninformation. \\xa0He kept muttering to himself, “Offal Court--that is the\\nname; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I\\ndrop, then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and\\nprove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have\\nmine own again.” \\xa0And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment\\nby those rude Christ’s Hospital boys, and he said, “When I am king, they\\nshall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books;\\nfor a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the\\nheart. \\xa0I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day’s\\nlesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning\\nsofteneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.” {1}\\n\\nThe lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a\\nraw and gusty night set in. \\xa0The houseless prince, the homeless heir to\\nthe throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze\\nof squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were\\nmassed together.\\n\\nSuddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--\\n\\n“Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home,\\nI warrant me! \\xa0If it be so, an’ I do not break all the bones in thy lean\\nbody, then am I not John Canty, but some other.”\\n\\nThe prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned\\nshoulder, and eagerly said--\\n\\n“Oh, art _his_ father, truly? \\xa0Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt\\nthou fetch him away and restore me!”\\n\\n“_His_ father? \\xa0I know not what thou mean’st; I but know I am _thy_\\nfather, as thou shalt soon have cause to--”\\n\\n“Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can\\nbear no more. \\xa0Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich\\nbeyond thy wildest dreams. \\xa0Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no\\nlie, but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me! \\xa0I am indeed\\nthe Prince of Wales!”\\n\\nThe man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and\\nmuttered--\\n\\n“Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam!”--then collared him once more,\\nand said with a coarse laugh and an oath, “But mad or no mad, I and thy\\nGammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or\\nI’m no true man!”\\n\\nWith this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and\\ndisappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of\\nhuman vermin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician.\\n\\nTom Canty, left alone in the prince’s cabinet, made good use of his\\nopportunity. \\xa0He turned himself this way and that before the great\\nmirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince’s\\nhigh-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. \\xa0Next he\\ndrew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it\\nacross his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to\\nthe lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering\\nthe great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. \\xa0Tom\\nplayed with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined\\nthe costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the\\nsumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court\\nherd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. \\xa0He wondered if\\nthey would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home,\\nor if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination\\nhad at last upset his reason.\\n\\nAt the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince\\nwas gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very\\nsoon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the\\npretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.\\nSuppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince’s clothes, and\\nthe prince not there to explain. \\xa0Might they not hang him at once,\\nand inquire into his case afterward? \\xa0He had heard that the great\\nwere prompt about small matters. \\xa0His fear rose higher and higher; and\\ntrembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to\\nfly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release. \\xa0Six\\ngorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed\\nlike butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him. \\xa0He\\nstepped quickly back and shut the door. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“Oh, they mock at me! \\xa0They will go and tell. \\xa0Oh! why came I here to\\ncast away my life?”\\n\\nHe walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening,\\nstarting at every trifling sound. \\xa0Presently the door swung open, and a\\nsilken page said--\\n\\n“The Lady Jane Grey.”\\n\\nThe door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.\\nBut she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice--\\n\\n“Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?”\\n\\nTom’s breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out--\\n\\n“Ah, be merciful, thou! \\xa0In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty\\nof Offal Court in the city. \\xa0Prithee let me see the prince, and he will\\nof his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt. \\xa0Oh, be\\nthou merciful, and save me!”\\n\\nBy this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes\\nand uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. \\xa0The young girl seemed\\nhorror-stricken. \\xa0She cried out--\\n\\n“O my lord, on thy knees?--and to _me_!”\\n\\nThen she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down,\\nmurmuring--\\n\\n“There is no help, there is no hope. \\xa0Now will they come and take me.”\\n\\nWhilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding\\nthrough the palace. \\xa0The whisper--for it was whispered always--flew from\\nmenial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from\\nstory to story, from saloon to saloon, “The prince hath gone mad, the\\nprince hath gone mad!” \\xa0Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its\\ngroups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling\\nlesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face\\nhad in it dismay. Presently a splendid official came marching by these\\ngroups, making solemn proclamation--\\n\\n“IN THE NAME OF THE KING!\\n\\nLet none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor\\ndiscuss the same, nor carry it abroad. \\xa0In the name of the King!”\\n\\nThe whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been\\nstricken dumb.\\n\\nSoon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of “The prince! See,\\nthe prince comes!”\\n\\nPoor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to\\nbow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with\\nbewildered and pathetic eyes. \\xa0Great nobles walked upon each side of\\nhim, making him lean upon them, and so steady his steps. Behind him\\nfollowed the court-physicians and some servants.\\n\\nPresently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard\\nthe door close behind him. \\xa0Around him stood those who had come with\\nhim. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very\\nfat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression. \\xa0His large\\nhead was very grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his\\nface, like a frame, were grey also. \\xa0His clothing was of rich stuff,\\nbut old, and slightly frayed in places. \\xa0One of his swollen legs had a\\npillow under it, and was wrapped in bandages. \\xa0There was silence now;\\nand there was no head there but was bent in reverence, except this\\nman’s. \\xa0This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII. \\xa0He\\nsaid--and his face grew gentle as he began to speak--\\n\\n“How now, my lord Edward, my prince? \\xa0Hast been minded to cozen me, the\\ngood King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a\\nsorry jest?”\\n\\nPoor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him,\\nto the beginning of this speech; but when the words ‘me, the good King’\\nfell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon\\nhis knees as if a shot had brought him there. Lifting up his hands, he\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“Thou the _King_? \\xa0Then am I undone indeed!”\\n\\nThis speech seemed to stun the King. \\xa0His eyes wandered from face to\\nface aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him. \\xa0Then\\nhe said in a tone of deep disappointment--\\n\\n“Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I\\nfear me ’tis not so.” \\xa0He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle\\nvoice, “Come to thy father, child: \\xa0thou art not well.”\\n\\nTom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England,\\nhumble and trembling. \\xa0The King took the frightened face between his\\nhands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking\\nsome grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly\\nhead against his breast, and patted it tenderly. \\xa0Presently he said--\\n\\n“Dost not know thy father, child? \\xa0Break not mine old heart; say thou\\nknow’st me. \\xa0Thou _dost_ know me, dost thou not?”\\n\\n“Yea: \\xa0thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!”\\n\\n“True, true--that is well--be comforted, tremble not so; there is none\\nhere would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou art better\\nnow; thy ill dream passeth--is’t not so? \\xa0Thou wilt not miscall thyself\\nagain, as they say thou didst a little while agone?”\\n\\n“I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most\\ndread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper\\nborn, and ’tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was\\ntherein nothing blameful. \\xa0I am but young to die, and thou canst save me\\nwith one little word. \\xa0Oh speak it, sir!”\\n\\n“Die? \\xa0Talk not so, sweet prince--peace, peace, to thy troubled\\nheart--thou shalt not die!”\\n\\nTom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry--\\n\\n“God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy\\nland!” Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords\\nin waiting, and exclaimed, “Thou heard’st it! \\xa0I am not to die: \\xa0the\\nKing hath said it!” \\xa0There was no movement, save that all bowed with\\ngrave respect; but no one spoke. \\xa0He hesitated, a little confused, then\\nturned timidly toward the King, saying, “I may go now?”\\n\\n“Go? \\xa0Surely, if thou desirest. \\xa0But why not tarry yet a little? Whither\\nwould’st go?”\\n\\nTom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly--\\n\\n“Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved\\nto seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which\\nharboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these\\npomps and splendours whereunto I am not used--oh, please you, sir, to\\nlet me go!”\\n\\nThe King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a\\ngrowing distress and uneasiness. \\xa0Presently he said, with something of\\nhope in his voice--\\n\\n“Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits\\nunmarred as toucheth other matter. \\xa0God send it may be so! \\xa0We will make\\ntrial.”\\n\\nThen he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in\\nthe same tongue. \\xa0The lords and doctors manifested their gratification\\nalso. The King said--\\n\\n“‘Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his\\nmind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. \\xa0How say you, sir?”\\n\\nThe physician addressed bowed low, and replied--\\n\\n“It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined\\naright.”\\n\\nThe King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from\\nso excellent authority, and continued with good heart--\\n\\n“Now mark ye all: \\xa0we will try him further.”\\n\\nHe put a question to Tom in French. \\xa0Tom stood silent a moment,\\nembarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said\\ndiffidently--\\n\\n“I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty.”\\n\\nThe King fell back upon his couch. \\xa0The attendants flew to his\\nassistance; but he put them aside, and said--\\n\\n“Trouble me not--it is nothing but a scurvy faintness. \\xa0Raise me! There,\\n‘tis sufficient. \\xa0Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head\\nupon thy father’s heart, and be at peace. \\xa0Thou’lt soon be well:  ’tis\\nbut a passing fantasy. \\xa0Fear thou not; thou’lt soon be well.” \\xa0Then\\nhe turned toward the company: \\xa0his gentle manner changed, and baleful\\nlightnings began to play from his eyes. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“List ye all! \\xa0This my son is mad; but it is not permanent. \\xa0Over-study\\nhath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement. \\xa0Away with his\\nbooks and teachers! see ye to it. \\xa0Pleasure him with sports, beguile him\\nin wholesome ways, so that his health come again.” \\xa0He raised himself\\nhigher still, and went on with energy, “He is mad; but he is my son,\\nand England’s heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! \\xa0And hear ye\\nfurther, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh\\nagainst the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!\\n. . . Give me to drink--I burn: \\xa0this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . .\\nThere, take away the cup. . . . Support me. \\xa0There, that is well. \\xa0Mad,\\nis he? \\xa0Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I\\nthe King will confirm it. \\xa0This very morrow shall he be installed in his\\nprincely dignity in due and ancient form. \\xa0Take instant order for it, my\\nlord Hertford.”\\n\\nOne of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said--\\n\\n“The King’s majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England\\nlieth attainted in the Tower. \\xa0It were not meet that one attainted--”\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0Insult not mine ears with his hated name. \\xa0Is this man to\\nlive for ever? \\xa0Am I to be baulked of my will? \\xa0Is the prince to tarry\\nuninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal\\nfree of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the\\nsplendour of God! \\xa0Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk’s doom before\\nthe sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!” {1}\\n\\nLord Hertford said--\\n\\n“The King’s will is law;” and, rising, returned to his former place.\\n\\nGradually the wrath faded out of the old King’s face, and he said--\\n\\n“Kiss me, my prince. \\xa0There . . . what fearest thou? \\xa0Am I not thy\\nloving father?”\\n\\n“Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that\\nin truth I know. \\xa0But--but--it grieveth me to think of him that is to\\ndie, and--”\\n\\n“Ah, ’tis like thee, ’tis like thee! \\xa0I know thy heart is still the\\nsame, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a\\ngentle spirit. \\xa0But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours:\\n\\xa0I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great\\noffice. Comfort thee, my prince: \\xa0trouble not thy poor head with this\\nmatter.”\\n\\n“But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? \\xa0How long might he not\\nlive, but for me?”\\n\\n“Take no thought of him, my prince: \\xa0he is not worthy. \\xa0Kiss me once\\nagain, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth\\nme. \\xa0I am aweary, and would rest. \\xa0Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy\\npeople, and come again when my body is refreshed.”\\n\\nTom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last\\nsentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would\\nbe set free. \\xa0Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, “The\\nprince, the prince comes!”\\n\\nHis spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering\\nfiles of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a\\ncaptive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a\\nforlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him\\nand set him free.\\n\\nAnd, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the\\nsevered head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the\\neyes fixed on him reproachfully.\\n\\nHis old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. Tom receives instructions.\\n\\nTom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made\\nto sit down--a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly\\nmen and men of high degree about him. \\xa0He begged them to be seated\\nalso, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained\\nstanding. He would have insisted, but his ‘uncle’ the Earl of Hertford\\nwhispered in his ear--\\n\\n“Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy\\npresence.”\\n\\nThe Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I come upon the King’s errand, concerning a matter which requireth\\nprivacy. \\xa0Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend\\nyou here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?”\\n\\nObserving that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford\\nwhispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to\\nspeak unless he chose. \\xa0When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St.\\nJohn said--\\n\\n“His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the\\nprince’s grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his\\npower, till it be passed and he be as he was before. \\xa0To wit, that he\\nshall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England’s\\ngreatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive,\\nwithout word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which\\nunto it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to\\nspeak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured\\nout of the unwholesome imaginings of o’er-wrought fancy; that he shall\\nstrive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which\\nhe was wont to know--and where he faileth he shall hold his peace,\\nneither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath\\nforgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall\\nperplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should\\nmake, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but\\ntake advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self,\\nwhich are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at\\ncall, till this commandment be dissolved. Thus saith the King’s majesty,\\nwho sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will\\nof His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy\\nkeeping.”\\n\\nThe Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside. \\xa0Tom replied\\nresignedly--\\n\\n“The King hath said it. \\xa0None may palter with the King’s command, or fit\\nit to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall\\nbe obeyed.”\\n\\nLord Hertford said--\\n\\n“Touching the King’s majesty’s ordainment concerning books and such like\\nserious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your\\ntime with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet\\nand suffer harm thereby.”\\n\\nTom’s face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw\\nLord St. John’s eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. \\xa0His lordship said--\\n\\n“Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise--but\\nsuffer it not to trouble thee, for ’tis a matter that will not bide,\\nbut depart with thy mending malady. \\xa0My Lord of Hertford speaketh of\\nthe city’s banquet which the King’s majesty did promise, some two months\\nflown, your highness should attend. \\xa0Thou recallest it now?”\\n\\n“It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,” said Tom, in a\\nhesitating voice; and blushed again.\\n\\nAt this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.\\nThe two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped\\nquickly toward the door. \\xa0As the young girls passed him, he said in a\\nlow voice--\\n\\n“I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise\\nwhen his memory doth lapse--it will grieve you to note how it doth stick\\nat every trifle.”\\n\\nMeantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom’s ear--\\n\\n“Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty’s desire. Remember\\nall thou canst--_seem_ to remember all else. \\xa0Let them not perceive that\\nthou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy\\nold play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how ’twould grieve them.\\nArt willing, sir, that I remain?--and thine uncle?”\\n\\nTom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was\\nalready learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself\\nas best he might, according to the King’s command.\\n\\nIn spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people\\nbecame a little embarrassing at times. \\xa0More than once, in truth,\\nTom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his\\ntremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a\\nword from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently\\nby chance, had the same happy effect. \\xa0Once the little Lady Jane turned\\nto Tom and dismayed him with this question,--\\n\\n“Hast paid thy duty to the Queen’s majesty to-day, my lord?”\\n\\nTom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something\\nat hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him\\nwith the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate\\ndifficulties and to be ready for them--\\n\\n“He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his\\nmajesty’s condition; is it not so, your highness?”\\n\\nTom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was\\ngetting upon dangerous ground. \\xa0Somewhat later it was mentioned that\\nTom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“‘Tis a pity, ’tis a pity! \\xa0Thou wert proceeding bravely. \\xa0But bide thy\\ntime in patience: \\xa0it will not be for long. \\xa0Thou’lt yet be graced\\nwith learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many\\nlanguages as his, good my prince.”\\n\\n“My father!” cried Tom, off his guard for the moment.  “I trow he cannot\\nspeak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may\\ntell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever--”\\n\\nHe looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John’s\\neyes.\\n\\nHe stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: “Ah, my malady\\npersecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth. \\xa0I meant the King’s grace\\nno irreverence.”\\n\\n“We know it, sir,” said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her ‘brother’s’\\nhand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; “trouble not\\nthyself as to that. \\xa0The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper’s.”\\n\\n“Thou’rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,” said Tom, gratefully, “and my\\nheart moveth me to thank thee for’t, an’ I may be so bold.”\\n\\nOnce the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.\\n\\xa0The Princess Elizabeth’s quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the\\ntarget’s front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered\\na return volley of sounding Greek on Tom’s behalf, and then straightway\\nchanged the talk to other matters.\\n\\nTime wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole. Snags and\\nsandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at\\nhis ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and\\noverlooking his mistakes. \\xa0When it came out that the little ladies were\\nto accompany him to the Lord Mayor’s banquet in the evening, his heart\\ngave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be\\nfriendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an\\nhour earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an\\ninsupportable terror to him.\\n\\nTom’s guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the\\ninterview than the other parties to it. \\xa0They felt much as if they were\\npiloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the\\nalert constantly, and found their office no child’s play. Wherefore,\\nat last, when the ladies’ visit was drawing to a close and the Lord\\nGuilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had\\nbeen sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves\\nwere not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their\\nanxious voyage all over again. \\xa0So they respectfully advised Tom to\\nexcuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade\\nof disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane’s face when\\nshe heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.\\n\\nThere was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not\\nunderstand. \\xa0He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign--but he\\nfailed to understand that also. \\xa0The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue\\nwith her usual easy grace. \\xa0She made reverence and said--\\n\\n“Have we leave of the prince’s grace my brother to go?”\\n\\nTom said--\\n\\n“Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the\\nasking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor\\npower lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence\\nhence. \\xa0Give ye good den, and God be with ye!” Then he smiled inwardly\\nat the thought, “‘Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in\\nmy reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered\\nand gracious speech withal!”\\n\\nWhen the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his\\nkeepers and said--\\n\\n“May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner\\nand rest me?”\\n\\nLord Hertford said--\\n\\n“So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to\\nobey. That thou should’st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou\\nmust journey to the city presently.”\\n\\nHe touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the\\npresence of Sir William Herbert. \\xa0This gentleman came straightway, and\\nconducted Tom to an inner apartment. \\xa0Tom’s first movement there was\\nto reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it,\\ndropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver.\\n\\nNext the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins,\\ntimidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet\\ndiscomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him. \\xa0He\\nmade two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly\\nforestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation\\nand a murmured “Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe\\nfor me also!” \\xa0Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid\\nhimself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too\\nfull of thoughts and the room too full of people. \\xa0He could not dismiss\\nthe former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the\\nlatter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret--and theirs.\\n\\nTom’s departure had left his two noble guardians alone. \\xa0They mused a\\nwhile, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Plainly, what dost thou think?”\\n\\n“Plainly, then, this. \\xa0The King is near his end; my nephew is mad--mad\\nwill mount the throne, and mad remain. \\xa0God protect England, since she\\nwill need it!”\\n\\n“Verily it promiseth so, indeed. \\xa0But . . . have you no misgivings as to\\n. . . as to . . .”\\n\\nThe speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. \\xa0He evidently felt that he\\nwas upon delicate ground. \\xa0Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into\\nhis face with a clear, frank eye, and said--\\n\\n“Speak on--there is none to hear but me. \\xa0Misgivings as to what?”\\n\\n“I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near\\nto him in blood, my lord. \\xa0But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it\\nnot strange that madness could so change his port and manner?--not but\\nthat his port and speech are princely still, but that they _differ_,\\nin one unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime.\\n\\xa0Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his\\nfather’s very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due\\nfrom such as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his\\nGreek and French? \\xa0My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its\\ndisquiet and receive my grateful thanks. \\xa0It haunteth me, his saying he\\nwas not the prince, and so--”\\n\\n“Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason! \\xa0Hast forgot the King’s command?\\nRemember I am party to thy crime if I but listen.”\\n\\nSt. John paled, and hastened to say--\\n\\n“I was in fault, I do confess it. \\xa0Betray me not, grant me this grace\\nout of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing\\nmore. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined.”\\n\\n“I am content, my lord. \\xa0So thou offend not again, here or in the\\nears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken. \\xa0But thou\\nneed’st not have misgivings. \\xa0He is my sister’s son; are not his voice,\\nhis face, his form, familiar to me from his cradle? Madness can do all\\nthe odd conflicting things thou seest in him, and more. \\xa0Dost not recall\\nhow that the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his\\nown countenance that he had known for sixty years, and held it was\\nanother’s; nay, even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that\\nhis head was made of Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none\\nto touch it, lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? \\xa0Give\\nthy misgivings easement, good my lord. \\xa0This is the very prince--I know\\nhim well--and soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this\\nin mind, and more dwell upon it than the other.”\\n\\nAfter some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his\\nmistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was\\nthoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the\\nLord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and\\nward alone. \\xa0He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he\\nthought, the more he was bothered. \\xa0By-and-by he began to pace the floor\\nand mutter.\\n\\n“Tush, he _must_ be the prince! \\xa0Will any be in all the land maintain\\nthere can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?\\n\\xa0And even were it so, ’twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should\\ncast the one into the other’s place. Nay, ’tis folly, folly, folly!”\\n\\nPresently he said--\\n\\n“Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you _that_ would\\nbe natural; that would be reasonable. \\xa0But lived ever an impostor yet,\\nwho, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by\\nall, _denied_ his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation? \\xa0_No_! \\xa0By\\nthe soul of St. Swithin, no! \\xa0This is the true prince, gone mad!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. Tom’s first royal dinner.\\n\\nSomewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal\\nof being dressed for dinner. \\xa0He found himself as finely clothed as\\nbefore, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to\\nhis stockings. \\xa0He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious\\nand ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one. \\xa0Its\\nfurniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which\\nwell-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. \\xa0The\\nroom was half-filled with noble servitors. \\xa0A chaplain said grace, and\\nTom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with\\nhim, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a\\nnapkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince\\nof Wales was hereditary in this nobleman’s family. \\xa0Tom’s cupbearer was\\npresent, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. \\xa0The\\nTaster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to\\ntaste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being\\npoisoned. \\xa0He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was\\nseldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times,\\nnot many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils,\\nand was not a grandeur to be desired. \\xa0Why they did not use a dog or a\\nplumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange. \\xa0My\\nLord d’Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows\\nwhat; but there he was--let that suffice. \\xa0The Lord Chief Butler was\\nthere, and stood behind Tom’s chair, overseeing the solemnities, under\\ncommand of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood\\nnear. \\xa0Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these;\\nbut they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them;\\nneither was Tom aware yet that they existed.\\n\\nAll those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to\\nremember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be\\ncareful to show no surprise at his vagaries. \\xa0These ‘vagaries’ were\\nsoon on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and\\ntheir sorrow, not their mirth. \\xa0It was a heavy affliction to them to see\\nthe beloved prince so stricken.\\n\\nPoor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even\\nseemed to observe it. \\xa0He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep\\ninterest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said\\nwith simplicity--\\n\\n“Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.”\\n\\nThe Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without\\nword or protest of any sort.\\n\\nTom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what\\nthey were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that\\nmen had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing\\nthem as luxuries from Holland. {1} \\xa0His question was answered with grave\\nrespect, and no surprise manifested. \\xa0When he had finished his dessert,\\nhe filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it,\\nor disturbed by it. \\xa0But the next moment he was himself disturbed by\\nit, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been\\npermitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt\\nthat he had done a most improper and unprincely thing. \\xa0At that moment\\nthe muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to\\nlift and wrinkle. \\xa0This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing\\ndistress. \\xa0He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the\\nlords about him, and tears came into his eyes. \\xa0They sprang forward with\\ndismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble. \\xa0Tom said with\\ngenuine anguish--\\n\\n“I crave your indulgence: \\xa0my nose itcheth cruelly. \\xa0What is the custom\\nand usage in this emergence? \\xa0Prithee, speed, for ’tis but a little time\\nthat I can bear it.”\\n\\nNone smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other\\nin deep tribulation for counsel. \\xa0But behold, here was a dead wall, and\\nnothing in English history to tell how to get over it. \\xa0The Master of\\nCeremonies was not present: \\xa0there was no one who felt safe to venture\\nupon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn\\nproblem. \\xa0Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher. \\xa0Meantime the tears\\nhad overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom’s cheeks. \\xa0His\\ntwitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. \\xa0At last\\nnature broke down the barriers of etiquette: \\xa0Tom lifted up an inward\\nprayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the\\nburdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.\\n\\nHis meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow,\\ngolden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and\\nfingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin\\nfor his use. \\xa0Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised\\nit to his lips, and gravely took a draught. \\xa0Then he returned it to the\\nwaiting lord, and said--\\n\\n“Nay, it likes me not, my lord: \\xa0it hath a pretty flavour, but it\\nwanteth strength.”\\n\\nThis new eccentricity of the prince’s ruined mind made all the hearts\\nabout him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.\\n\\nTom’s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table\\njust when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with\\nuplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning\\nthe blessing. \\xa0Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done\\na thing unusual.\\n\\nBy his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private\\ncabinet, and left there alone to his own devices. \\xa0Hanging upon hooks in\\nthe oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel\\narmour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid\\nin gold. \\xa0This martial panoply belonged to the true prince--a recent\\npresent from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the\\ngauntlets, the plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don\\nwithout assistance, and for a while was minded to call for help and\\ncomplete the matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away\\nfrom dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye\\nhim, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services;\\nso he restored the pretty things to their several places, and soon was\\ncracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time\\nsince God for his sins had made him a prince. \\xa0When the nuts were all\\ngone, he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet, among them one\\nabout the etiquette of the English court. \\xa0This was a prize. He lay down\\nupon a sumptuous divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest\\nzeal. \\xa0Let us leave him there for the present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. The Question of the Seal.\\n\\nAbout five o’clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and\\nmuttered to himself, “Troublous dreams, troublous dreams! Mine end is\\nnow at hand: \\xa0so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm\\nit.” Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered,\\n“Yet will not I die till _He_ go before.”\\n\\nHis attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his\\npleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.\\n\\n“Admit him, admit him!” exclaimed the King eagerly.\\n\\nThe Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King’s couch, saying--\\n\\n“I have given order, and, according to the King’s command, the peers of\\nthe realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where,\\nhaving confirmed the Duke of Norfolk’s doom, they humbly wait his\\nmajesty’s further pleasure in the matter.”\\n\\nThe King’s face lit up with a fierce joy. \\xa0Said he--\\n\\n“Lift me up! \\xa0In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and\\nwith mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of--”\\n\\nHis voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and\\nthe attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted\\nhim with restoratives. \\xa0Presently he said sorrowfully--\\n\\n“Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it\\ncometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. \\xa0But speed ye, speed\\nye! let others do this happy office sith ’tis denied to me. I put my\\nGreat Seal in commission: \\xa0choose thou the lords that shall compose it,\\nand get ye to your work. \\xa0Speed ye, man! \\xa0Before the sun shall rise and\\nset again, bring me his head that I may see it.”\\n\\n“According to the King’s command, so shall it be. \\xa0Will’t please your\\nmajesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may\\nforth upon the business?”\\n\\n“The Seal? \\xa0Who keepeth the Seal but thou?”\\n\\n“Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it\\nshould no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon\\nthe Duke of Norfolk’s warrant.”\\n\\n“Why, so in sooth I did: \\xa0I do remember. . . . What did I with it?...\\nI am very feeble. . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the\\ntraitor with me. . . . ’tis strange, strange--”\\n\\nThe King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head\\nweakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he\\nhad done with the Seal. \\xa0At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and\\noffer information--\\n\\n“Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with\\nme how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the\\nPrince of Wales to keep against the day that--”\\n\\n“True, most true!” interrupted the King.  “Fetch it! \\xa0Go: \\xa0time flieth!”\\n\\nLord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long,\\ntroubled and empty-handed. \\xa0He delivered himself to this effect--\\n\\n“It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome\\ntidings; but it is the will of God that the prince’s affliction abideth\\nstill, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal. \\xa0So came\\nI quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and\\nlittle worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of\\nchambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high--”\\n\\nA groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point. \\xa0After a\\nlittle while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone--\\n\\n“Trouble him no more, poor child. \\xa0The hand of God lieth heavy upon him,\\nand my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I\\nmay not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so\\nbring him peace.”\\n\\nHe closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After\\na time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his\\nglance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face\\nflushed with wrath--\\n\\n“What, thou here yet! \\xa0By the glory of God, an’ thou gettest not about\\nthat traitor’s business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for\\nlack of a head to grace withal!”\\n\\nThe trembling Chancellor answered--\\n\\n“Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! \\xa0I but waited for the Seal.”\\n\\n“Man, hast lost thy wits? \\xa0The small Seal which aforetime I was wont\\nto take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. \\xa0And, since the Great Seal\\nhath flown away, shall not it suffice? \\xa0Hast lost thy wits? \\xa0Begone!\\n\\xa0And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.”\\n\\nThe poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous\\nvicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent\\nto the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the\\nbeheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. The river pageant.\\n\\nAt nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was\\nblazing with light. \\xa0The river itself, as far as the eye could reach\\ncitywards, was so thickly covered with watermen’s boats and with\\npleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated\\nby the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of\\nflowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. \\xa0The grand terrace of\\nstone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army\\nof a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks\\nof royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly\\ncostumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of\\npreparation.\\n\\nPresently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures\\nvanished from the steps. \\xa0Now the air was heavy with the hush of\\nsuspense and expectancy. \\xa0As far as one’s vision could carry, he might\\nsee the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes\\nfrom the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace.\\n\\nA file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. \\xa0They were\\nrichly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.\\nSome of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with\\ncloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with\\nsilken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them,\\nwhich shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes\\nfluttered them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to\\nnobles in the prince’s immediate service, had their sides picturesquely\\nfenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings. \\xa0Each\\nstate barge was towed by a tender. \\xa0Besides the rowers, these tenders\\ncarried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate,\\nand a company of musicians.\\n\\nThe advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great\\ngateway, a troop of halberdiers.  ‘They were dressed in striped hose of\\nblack and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and\\ndoublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back\\nwith the three feathers, the prince’s blazon, woven in gold. \\xa0Their\\nhalberd staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt\\nnails, and ornamented with gold tassels. \\xa0Filing off on the right and\\nleft, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the\\npalace to the water’s edge. \\xa0A thick rayed cloth or carpet was\\nthen unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the\\ngold-and-crimson liveries of the prince. \\xa0This done, a flourish of\\ntrumpets resounded from within. \\xa0A lively prelude arose from the\\nmusicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a\\nslow and stately pace from the portal. \\xa0They were followed by an officer\\nbearing the civic mace, after whom came another carrying the city’s\\nsword; then several sergeants of the city guard, in their full\\naccoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the Garter\\nKing-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with\\na white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in\\ntheir robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of\\nEngland, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever;\\nthen a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the\\nheads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state. Now\\ncame twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of\\npourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of\\ncrimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured\\nhauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps. \\xa0They were of the\\nsuite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of\\nthe suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved\\nby any ornament. \\xa0Following these came several great English nobles with\\ntheir attendants.’\\n\\nThere was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince’s uncle, the\\nfuture great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a\\n‘doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered\\nwith gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.’ \\xa0He turned, doffed\\nhis plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step\\nbackward, bowing at each step. \\xa0A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and\\na proclamation, “Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of\\nWales!” \\xa0High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of\\nflame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river\\nburst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero\\nof it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.\\n\\nHe was ‘magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a\\nfront-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged\\nwith ermine. \\xa0Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced\\nwith the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls\\nand precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants. \\xa0About his\\nneck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;’\\nand wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.\\n\\xa0O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar\\nwith rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. The Prince in the toils.\\n\\nWe left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with\\na noisy and delighted mob at his heels. \\xa0There was but one person in it\\nwho offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he\\nwas hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil. \\xa0The Prince continued\\nto struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was\\nsuffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him,\\nand raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince’s head.\\n\\xa0The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man’s arm, and the\\nblow descended upon his own wrist. \\xa0Canty roared out--\\n\\n“Thou’lt meddle, wilt thou? \\xa0Then have thy reward.”\\n\\nHis cudgel crashed down upon the meddler’s head: \\xa0there was a groan, a\\ndim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next\\nmoment it lay there in the dark alone. \\xa0The mob pressed on, their\\nenjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.\\n\\nPresently the Prince found himself in John Canty’s abode, with the door\\nclosed against the outsiders. \\xa0By the vague light of a tallow candle\\nwhich was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the\\nloathsome den, and also the occupants of it. \\xa0Two frowsy girls and\\na middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the\\naspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading\\nit now. From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey\\nhair and malignant eyes. \\xa0John Canty said to this one--\\n\\n“Tarry! \\xa0There’s fine mummeries here. \\xa0Mar them not till thou’st enjoyed\\nthem: \\xa0then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt. \\xa0Stand forth, lad. \\xa0Now\\nsay thy foolery again, an thou’st not forgot it. Name thy name. \\xa0Who art\\nthou?”\\n\\nThe insulted blood mounted to the little prince’s cheek once more, and\\nhe lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man’s face and said--\\n\\n“‘Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak. \\xa0I tell\\nthee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none\\nother.”\\n\\nThe stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag’s feet to the floor\\nwhere she stood, and almost took her breath. \\xa0She stared at the Prince\\nin stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst\\ninto a roar of laughter. \\xa0But the effect upon Tom Canty’s mother and\\nsisters was different. \\xa0Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to\\ndistress of a different sort. \\xa0They ran forward with woe and dismay in\\ntheir faces, exclaiming--\\n\\n“Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!”\\n\\nThe mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his\\nshoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.\\nThen she said--\\n\\n“Oh, my poor boy! \\xa0Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at\\nlast, and ta’en thy wit away. \\xa0Ah! why did’st thou cleave to it when I\\nso warned thee ‘gainst it? \\xa0Thou’st broke thy mother’s heart.”\\n\\nThe Prince looked into her face, and said gently--\\n\\n“Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame. \\xa0Comfort thee:\\nlet me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my\\nfather restore him to thee.”\\n\\n“The King thy father! \\xa0Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted\\nwith death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee. \\xa0Shake of\\nthis gruesome dream. \\xa0Call back thy poor wandering memory. \\xa0Look upon\\nme. Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?”\\n\\nThe Prince shook his head and reluctantly said--\\n\\n“God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never\\nlooked upon thy face before.”\\n\\nThe woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her\\neyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.\\n\\n“Let the show go on!” shouted Canty.  “What, Nan!--what, Bet! mannerless\\nwenches! will ye stand in the Prince’s presence? \\xa0Upon your knees, ye\\npauper scum, and do him reverence!”\\n\\nHe followed this with another horse-laugh. \\xa0The girls began to plead\\ntimidly for their brother; and Nan said--\\n\\n“An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his\\nmadness: \\xa0prithee, do.”\\n\\n“Do, father,” said Bet; “he is more worn than is his wont. \\xa0To-morrow\\nwill he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not\\nempty home again.”\\n\\nThis remark sobered the father’s joviality, and brought his mind to\\nbusiness. \\xa0He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said--\\n\\n“The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two\\npennies, mark ye--all this money for a half-year’s rent, else out of\\nthis we go. \\xa0Show what thou’st gathered with thy lazy begging.”\\n\\nThe Prince said--\\n\\n“Offend me not with thy sordid matters. \\xa0I tell thee again I am the\\nKing’s son.”\\n\\nA sounding blow upon the Prince’s shoulder from Canty’s broad palm\\nsent him staggering into goodwife Canty’s arms, who clasped him to her\\nbreast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by\\ninterposing her own person. \\xa0The frightened girls retreated to their\\ncorner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.\\n\\xa0The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming--\\n\\n“Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam. \\xa0Let these swine do their will\\nupon me alone.”\\n\\nThis speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about\\ntheir work without waste of time. \\xa0Between them they belaboured the boy\\nright soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for\\nshowing sympathy for the victim.\\n\\n“Now,” said Canty, “to bed, all of ye. \\xa0The entertainment has tired me.”\\n\\nThe light was put out, and the family retired. \\xa0As soon as the snorings\\nof the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep,\\nthe young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly\\nfrom the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also,\\nand stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of\\ncomfort and compassion in his ear the while. \\xa0She had saved a morsel for\\nhim to eat, also; but the boy’s pains had swept away all appetite--at\\nleast for black and tasteless crusts. \\xa0He was touched by her brave and\\ncostly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in\\nvery noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try\\nto forget her sorrows. \\xa0And he added that the King his father would not\\nlet her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded. \\xa0This return to his\\n‘madness’ broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again\\nand again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.\\n\\nAs she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into\\nher mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was\\nlacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. \\xa0She could not describe it, she could\\nnot tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to\\ndetect it and perceive it. \\xa0What if the boy were really not her son,\\nafter all? \\xa0Oh, absurd! \\xa0She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her\\ngriefs and troubles. \\xa0No matter, she found that it was an idea that\\nwould not ‘down,’ but persisted in haunting her. \\xa0It pursued her, it\\nharassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.\\n\\xa0At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her\\nuntil she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without\\nquestion, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these\\nwearing and worrying doubts. \\xa0Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way\\nout of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to\\ncontrive that test. \\xa0But it was an easier thing to propose than to\\naccomplish. \\xa0She turned over in her mind one promising test after\\nanother, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were\\nabsolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not\\nsatisfy her. \\xa0Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed\\nmanifest that she must give the matter up. \\xa0While this depressing\\nthought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular\\nbreathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep. \\xa0And while she\\nlistened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled\\ncry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. \\xa0This chance occurrence\\nfurnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests\\ncombined. \\xa0She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work\\nto relight her candle, muttering to herself, “Had I but seen him _then_,\\nI should have known! \\xa0Since that day, when he was little, that the\\npowder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of\\nhis dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his\\neyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the\\npalm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a\\nhundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. \\xa0Yes, I shall\\nsoon know, now!”\\n\\nBy this time she had crept to the slumbering boy’s side, with the\\ncandle, shaded, in her hand. \\xa0She bent heedfully and warily over him,\\nscarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed\\nthe light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles.\\n\\xa0The sleeper’s eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about\\nhim--but he made no special movement with his hands.\\n\\nThe poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief;\\nbut she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the boy to sleep\\nagain; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon\\nthe disastrous result of her experiment. \\xa0She tried to believe that her\\nTom’s madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could\\nnot do it.  “No,” she said, “his _hands_ are not mad; they could not\\nunlearn so old a habit in so brief a time. \\xa0Oh, this is a heavy day for\\nme!”\\n\\nStill, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not\\nbring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing\\nagain--the failure must have been only an accident; so she startled the\\nboy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals--with the\\nsame result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to\\nbed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, “But I cannot give him up--oh\\nno, I cannot, I cannot--he _must_ be my boy!”\\n\\nThe poor mother’s interruptions having ceased, and the Prince’s pains\\nhaving gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at\\nlast sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep. Hour after hour\\nslipped away, and still he slept like the dead. Thus four or five hours\\npassed. Then his stupor began to lighten. Presently, while half asleep\\nand half awake, he murmured--\\n\\n“Sir William!”\\n\\nAfter a moment--\\n\\n“Ho, Sir William Herbert! \\xa0Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest\\ndream that ever . . . Sir William! dost hear? \\xa0Man, I did think me\\nchanged to a pauper, and . . . Ho there! \\xa0Guards! Sir William! \\xa0What!\\nis there no groom of the chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard\\nwith--”\\n\\n“What aileth thee?” asked a whisper near him.  “Who art thou calling?”\\n\\n“Sir William Herbert. \\xa0Who art thou?”\\n\\n“I? \\xa0Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? \\xa0Oh, Tom, I had forgot!\\nThou’rt mad yet--poor lad, thou’rt mad yet: \\xa0would I had never woke to\\nknow it again! \\xa0But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten\\ntill we die!”\\n\\nThe startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his\\nstiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his\\nfoul straw with a moan and the ejaculation--\\n\\n“Alas! it was no dream, then!”\\n\\nIn a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished\\nwere upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted\\nprince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but\\na pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for\\nbeasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.\\n\\nIn the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises\\nand shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. \\xa0The next moment\\nthere were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from\\nsnoring and said--\\n\\n“Who knocketh? \\xa0What wilt thou?”\\n\\nA voice answered--\\n\\n“Know’st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?”\\n\\n“No. \\xa0Neither know I, nor care.”\\n\\n“Belike thou’lt change thy note eftsoons. \\xa0An thou would save thy neck,\\nnothing but flight may stead thee. \\xa0The man is this moment delivering up\\nthe ghost.  ’Tis the priest, Father Andrew!”\\n\\n“God-a-mercy!” exclaimed Canty. \\xa0He roused his family, and hoarsely\\ncommanded, “Up with ye all and fly--or bide where ye are and perish!”\\n\\nScarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and\\nflying for their lives. \\xa0John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and\\nhurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice--\\n\\n“Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. \\xa0I will choose\\nme a new name, speedily, to throw the law’s dogs off the scent. \\xa0Mind\\nthy tongue, I tell thee!”\\n\\nHe growled these words to the rest of the family--\\n\\n“If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge;\\nwhoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper’s shop on the\\nbridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee\\ninto Southwark together.”\\n\\nAt this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light;\\nand not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing,\\ndancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.\\nThere was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up\\nand down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge\\nlikewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of\\ncoloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies\\nwith an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain\\nof dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were\\ncrowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large.\\n\\nJohn Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat;\\nbut it was too late. \\xa0He and his tribe were swallowed up in that\\nswarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in\\nan instant. We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe;\\nCanty still kept his grip upon him. \\xa0The Prince’s heart was beating high\\nwith hopes of escape, now. \\xa0A burly waterman, considerably exalted with\\nliquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough\\nthrough the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty’s shoulder and said--\\n\\n“Nay, whither so fast, friend? \\xa0Dost canker thy soul with sordid\\nbusiness when all that be leal men and true make holiday?”\\n\\n“Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not,” answered Canty,\\nroughly; “take away thy hand and let me pass.”\\n\\n“Sith that is thy humour, thou’lt _not_ pass, till thou’st drunk to the\\nPrince of Wales, I tell thee that,” said the waterman, barring the way\\nresolutely.\\n\\n“Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!”\\n\\nOther revellers were interested by this time. \\xa0They cried out--\\n\\n“The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the\\nloving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes.”\\n\\nSo a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of\\nits handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary\\nnapkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp\\nthe opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the\\nother, according to ancient custom. This left the Prince hand-free for\\na second, of course. \\xa0He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of\\nlegs about him and disappeared. \\xa0In another moment he could not have\\nbeen harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had\\nbeen the Atlantic’s and he a lost sixpence.\\n\\nHe very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about\\nhis own affairs without further thought of John Canty. \\xa0He quickly\\nrealised another thing, too. \\xa0To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales\\nwas being feasted by the city in his stead. \\xa0He easily concluded that\\nthe pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his\\nstupendous opportunity and become a usurper.\\n\\nTherefore there was but one course to pursue--find his way to the\\nGuildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. \\xa0He also made\\nup his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual\\npreparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the\\nlaw and usage of the day in cases of high treason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. At Guildhall.\\n\\nThe royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way\\ndown the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was\\nladen with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the\\ndistant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible\\nbonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted\\nwith sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like\\njewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted\\nfrom the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless\\nflash and boom of artillery.\\n\\nTo Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this\\nspectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his\\nlittle friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane\\nGrey, they were nothing.\\n\\nArrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook\\n(whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under\\nacres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges\\npopulous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to\\na halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient\\ncity of London. \\xa0Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession\\ncrossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and\\nBasinghall Street to the Guildhall.\\n\\nTom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord\\nMayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet\\nrobes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of\\nthe great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace\\nand the City Sword. \\xa0The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom\\nand his two small friends took their places behind their chairs.\\n\\nAt a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree\\nwere seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at\\na multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall. \\xa0From their lofty\\nvantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the\\ncity, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar\\nto it in forgotten generations. \\xa0There was a bugle-blast and a\\nproclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward\\nwall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a\\nroyal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife.\\n\\nAfter grace, Tom (being instructed) rose--and the whole house with\\nhim--and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess\\nElizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the\\ngeneral assemblage. \\xa0So the banquet began.\\n\\nBy midnight the revelry was at its height. \\xa0Now came one of those\\npicturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. \\xa0A description of it\\nis still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:\\n\\n‘Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after\\nthe Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on\\ntheir heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two\\nswords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold. \\xa0Next came\\nyet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,\\ntraversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of\\ncrimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on\\ntheir heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots\\nwith pykes’ (points a foot long), ’turned up. \\xa0And after them came\\na knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in\\ndoublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the\\ncannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over\\nthat, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after\\nthe dancers’ fashion, with pheasants’ feathers in them. \\xa0These were\\nappareled after the fashion of Prussia. \\xa0The torchbearers, which were\\nabout an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors,\\ntheir faces black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which\\nwere disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also,\\nthat it was a pleasure to behold.’\\n\\nAnd while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this ‘wild’ dancing,\\nlost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours\\nwhich the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the\\nragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and\\nhis wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at\\nthe gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously,\\nand pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.\\nPresently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him\\ninto a higher and still more entertaining fury. \\xa0Tears of mortification\\nsprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right\\nroyally. \\xa0Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!\\nAnd all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of\\ngrace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground,\\nbut will maintain it!”\\n\\n“Though thou be prince or no prince, ’tis all one, thou be’st a gallant\\nlad, and not friendless neither! \\xa0Here stand I by thy side to prove\\nit; and mind I tell thee thou might’st have a worser friend than Miles\\nHendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my\\nchild; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very\\nnative.”\\n\\nThe speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and\\nbearing. \\xa0He was tall, trim-built, muscular. \\xa0His doublet and trunks\\nwere of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace\\nadornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged;\\nthe plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and\\ndisreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron\\nsheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of\\nthe camp. \\xa0The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an\\nexplosion of jeers and laughter. \\xa0Some cried, “‘Tis another prince in\\ndisguise!” “‘Ware thy tongue, friend: \\xa0belike he is dangerous!”\\n  “Marry, he looketh it--mark his eye!”  “Pluck the lad from him--to the\\nhorse-pond wi’ the cub!”\\n\\nInstantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this\\nhappy thought; as instantly the stranger’s long sword was out and the\\nmeddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.\\nThe next moment a score of voices shouted, “Kill the dog! \\xa0Kill him!\\nKill him!” and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself\\nagainst a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a\\nmadman. \\xa0His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured\\nover their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with\\nundiminished fury.\\n\\nHis moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a\\ntrumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, “Way for the King’s messenger!”\\n and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of\\nharm’s reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger\\ncaught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and\\nthe multitude.\\n\\nReturn we within the Guildhall. \\xa0Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar\\nand thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. \\xa0There\\nwas instant silence--a deep hush; then a single voice rose--that of the\\nmessenger from the palace--and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the\\nwhole multitude standing listening.\\n\\nThe closing words, solemnly pronounced, were--\\n\\n“The King is dead!”\\n\\nThe great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one\\naccord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank\\nupon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a\\nmighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building--\\n\\n“Long live the King!”\\n\\nPoor Tom’s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle,\\nand finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a\\nmoment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his\\nface. \\xa0He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford’s ear--\\n\\n“Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! \\xa0Uttered I here a command,\\nthe which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter,\\nwould such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?”\\n\\n“None, my liege, in all these realms. \\xa0In thy person bides the majesty\\nof England. \\xa0Thou art the king--thy word is law.”\\n\\nTom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation--\\n\\n“Then shall the king’s law be law of mercy, from this day, and never\\nmore be law of blood! \\xa0Up from thy knees and away! \\xa0To the Tower, and\\nsay the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!”\\n\\nThe words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and\\nwide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another\\nprodigious shout burst forth--\\n\\n“The reign of blood is ended! \\xa0Long live Edward, King of England!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. The Prince and his Deliverer.\\n\\nAs soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob,\\nthey struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river. \\xa0Their\\nway was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they\\nploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon\\nthe Prince’s--no, the King’s--wrist. \\xa0The tremendous news was already\\nabroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once--“The King\\nis dead!” \\xa0The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little\\nwaif, and sent a shudder through his frame. \\xa0He realised the greatness\\nof his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who\\nhad been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him. \\xa0The\\ntears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects. \\xa0For an instant\\nhe felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God’s\\ncreatures--then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching\\nthunders:  “Long live King Edward the Sixth!” and this made his eyes\\nkindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers’ ends. “Ah,” he\\nthought, “how grand and strange it seems--_I am King_!”\\n\\nOur friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the\\nbridge. \\xa0This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and\\nhad been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious\\naffair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family\\nquarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of\\nthe river to the other. \\xa0The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it\\nhad its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food\\nmarkets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church. \\xa0It\\nlooked upon the two neighbours which it linked together--London\\nand Southwark--as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise\\nparticularly important. \\xa0It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was\\na narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its\\npopulation was but a village population and everybody in it knew all\\nhis fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers\\nbefore them--and all their little family affairs into the bargain. \\xa0It\\nhad its aristocracy, of course--its fine old families of butchers, and\\nbakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five\\nor six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from\\nbeginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked\\nbridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level,\\ndirect, substantial bridgy way. \\xa0It was just the sort of population to\\nbe narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the\\nBridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without\\never having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge\\nalone. \\xa0Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and\\ninterminable procession which moved through its street night and day,\\nwith its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing\\nand bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in\\nthis world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. \\xa0And so they\\nwere, in effect--at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and\\ndid--for a consideration--whenever a returning king or hero gave it a\\nfleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long,\\nstraight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.\\n\\nMen born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and\\ninane elsewhere. \\xa0History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at\\nthe age of seventy-one and retired to the country. \\xa0But he could only\\nfret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness\\nwas so painful, so awful, so oppressive. \\xa0When he was worn out with it,\\nat last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and\\nfell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of\\nthe lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge.\\n\\nIn the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished ‘object\\nlessons’ in English history for its children--namely, the livid and\\ndecaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its\\ngateways. \\xa0But we digress.\\n\\nHendon’s lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge. \\xa0As he neared\\nthe door with his small friend, a rough voice said--\\n\\n“So, thou’rt come at last! \\xa0Thou’lt not escape again, I warrant thee;\\nand if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou’lt\\nnot keep us waiting another time, mayhap,”--and John Canty put out his\\nhand to seize the boy.\\n\\nMiles Hendon stepped in the way and said--\\n\\n“Not too fast, friend. \\xa0Thou art needlessly rough, methinks. \\xa0What is\\nthe lad to thee?”\\n\\n“If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others’ affairs,\\nhe is my son.”\\n\\n“‘Tis a lie!” cried the little King, hotly.\\n\\n“Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound\\nor cracked, my boy. \\xa0But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father\\nor no, ’tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse,\\naccording to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me.”\\n\\n“I do, I do--I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go\\nwith him.”\\n\\n“Then ’tis settled, and there is nought more to say.”\\n\\n“We will see, as to that!” exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to\\nget at the boy; “by force shall he--”\\n\\n“If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee like a\\ngoose!” said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword\\nhilt. \\xa0Canty drew back.  “Now mark ye,” continued Hendon, “I took this\\nlad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled\\nhim, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser\\nfate?--for whether thou art his father or no--and sooth to say, I think\\nit is a lie--a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life\\nin such brute hands as thine. \\xa0So go thy ways, and set quick about it,\\nfor I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my\\nnature.”\\n\\nJohn Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed\\nfrom sight in the crowd. \\xa0Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his\\nroom, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither. \\xa0It\\nwas a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old\\nfurniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles.\\nThe little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost\\nexhausted with hunger and fatigue. \\xa0He had been on his feet a good\\npart of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o’clock in the\\nmorning), and had eaten nothing meantime. \\xa0He murmured drowsily--\\n\\n“Prithee call me when the table is spread,” and sank into a deep sleep\\nimmediately.\\n\\nA smile twinkled in Hendon’s eye, and he said to himself--\\n\\n“By the mass, the little beggar takes to one’s quarters and usurps one’s\\nbed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them--with never\\na by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort. \\xa0In his\\ndiseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth\\nhe keep up the character. \\xa0Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his\\nmind has been disordered with ill-usage. \\xa0Well, I will be his friend;\\nI have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the\\nbold-tongued little rascal. \\xa0How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble\\nand flung back his high defiance! \\xa0And what a comely, sweet and gentle\\nface he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its\\ngriefs. I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his\\nelder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would\\nshame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for\\nit he shall need it!”\\n\\nHe bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying\\ninterest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the\\ntangled curls with his great brown hand. \\xa0A slight shiver passed over\\nthe boy’s form. Hendon muttered--\\n\\n“See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill\\nhis body with deadly rheums. \\xa0Now what shall I do? ’twill wake him to\\ntake him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep.”\\n\\nHe looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet\\nand wrapped the lad in it, saying, “I am used to nipping air and scant\\napparel, ’tis little I shall mind the cold!”--then walked up and down\\nthe room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before.\\n\\n“His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; ’twill be odd to\\nhave a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that _was_ the prince\\nis prince no more, but king--for this poor mind is set upon the one\\nfantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince\\nand call itself the king. . . If my father liveth still, after these\\nseven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he\\nwill welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so\\nwill my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh--but I will\\ncrack his crown an _he_ interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned\\nanimal! Yes, thither will we fare--and straightway, too.”\\n\\nA servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal\\ntable, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap\\nlodgers as these to wait upon themselves. \\xa0The door slammed after him,\\nand the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot\\na glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he\\nmurmured to himself, with a deep sigh, “Alack, it was but a dream, woe\\nis me!” \\xa0Next he noticed Miles Hendon’s doublet--glanced from that to\\nHendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said,\\ngently--\\n\\n“Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me. \\xa0Take it and put it\\non--I shall not need it more.”\\n\\nThen he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood\\nthere, waiting. \\xa0Hendon said in a cheery voice--\\n\\n“We’ll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury\\nand smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little\\nman again, never fear!”\\n\\nThe boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with\\ngrave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall\\nknight of the sword. \\xa0Hendon was puzzled, and said--\\n\\n“What’s amiss?”\\n\\n“Good sir, I would wash me.”\\n\\n“Oh, is that all? \\xa0Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou\\ncravest. \\xa0Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that\\nare his belongings.”\\n\\nStill the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or\\ntwice with his small impatient foot. \\xa0Hendon was wholly perplexed. \\xa0Said\\nhe--\\n\\n“Bless us, what is it?”\\n\\n“Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!”\\n\\nHendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, “By all the\\nsaints, but this is admirable!” stepped briskly forward and did the\\nsmall insolent’s bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction,\\nuntil the command, “Come--the towel!” woke him sharply up. \\xa0He took up a\\ntowel, from under the boy’s nose, and handed it to him without comment.\\n\\xa0He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was\\nat it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall\\nto. Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the\\nother chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,\\nindignantly--\\n\\n“Forbear! \\xa0Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?”\\n\\nThis blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. \\xa0He muttered to himself,\\n“Lo, the poor thing’s madness is up with the time! \\xa0It hath changed\\nwith the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is\\nhe _king_! Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too--there is no other\\nway--faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!”\\n\\nAnd pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,\\ntook his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the\\ncourtliest way he was capable of.\\n\\nWhile the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little,\\nand with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said--“I\\nthink thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?”\\n\\n“Yes, Sire,” Miles replied; then observed to himself, “If I _must_\\nhumour the poor lad’s madness, I must ‘Sire’ him, I must ‘Majesty’ him,\\nI must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the\\npart I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable\\nand kindly cause.”\\n\\nThe King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said--“I\\nwould know thee--tell me thy story. \\xa0Thou hast a gallant way with thee,\\nand a noble--art nobly born?”\\n\\n“We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty. \\xa0My father is\\na baronet--one of the smaller lords by knight service {2}--Sir Richard\\nHendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk’s Holm in Kent.”\\n\\n“The name has escaped my memory. \\xa0Go on--tell me thy story.”\\n\\n“‘Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short\\nhalf-hour for want of a better. \\xa0My father, Sir Richard, is very rich,\\nand of a most generous nature. \\xa0My mother died whilst I was yet a\\nboy. \\xa0I have two brothers: \\xa0Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to\\nhis father’s; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous,\\ntreacherous, vicious, underhanded--a reptile. \\xa0Such was he from the\\ncradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him--a ripe rascal\\nat nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two. \\xa0There is\\nnone other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin--she was sixteen\\nthen--beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her\\nrace, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title. \\xa0My father was her\\nguardian. \\xa0I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur\\nfrom the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be\\nbroken. \\xa0Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and\\nhold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give\\nsuccess to our several causes. \\xa0Hugh loved the Lady Edith’s fortune,\\nthough in truth he said it was herself he loved--but then ’twas his way,\\nalway, to say the one thing and mean the other. \\xa0But he lost his arts\\nupon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else. \\xa0My father\\nloved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the\\nyoungest child, and others hated him--these qualities being in all\\nages sufficient to win a parent’s dearest love; and he had a smooth\\npersuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying--and these be\\nqualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself.\\n\\xa0I was wild--in troth I might go yet farther and say _very_ wild, though\\n‘twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought\\nshame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness,\\nor what might not beseem mine honourable degree.\\n\\n“Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account--he seeing\\nthat our brother Arthur’s health was but indifferent, and hoping the\\nworst might work him profit were I swept out of the path--so--but ’twere\\na long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling. \\xa0Briefly,\\nthen, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them\\ncrimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine\\napartments--conveyed thither by his own means--and did convince my\\nfather by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying\\nknaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in\\nrank defiance of his will.\\n\\n“Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier\\nand a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom.\\n\\xa0I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting\\nsumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last\\nbattle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed\\nand waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me. \\xa0Through wit\\nand courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and\\nam but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still\\nin knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall,\\nits people and belongings. \\xa0So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told.”\\n\\n“Thou hast been shamefully abused!” said the little King, with a\\nflashing eye.  “But I will right thee--by the cross will I! \\xa0The King\\nhath said it.”\\n\\nThen, fired by the story of Miles’s wrongs, he loosed his tongue and\\npoured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his\\nastonished listener. \\xa0When he had finished, Miles said to himself--\\n\\n“Lo, what an imagination he hath! \\xa0Verily, this is no common mind; else,\\ncrazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this\\nout of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt.\\nPoor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I\\nbide with the living. \\xa0He shall never leave my side; he shall be my\\npet, my little comrade. \\xa0And he shall be cured!--ay, made whole and\\nsound--then will he make himself a name--and proud shall I be to say,\\n‘Yes, he is mine--I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw\\nwhat was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day--behold\\nhim, observe him--was I right?’”\\n\\nThe King spoke--in a thoughtful, measured voice--\\n\\n“Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my\\ncrown. Such service demandeth rich reward. \\xa0Name thy desire, and so it\\nbe within the compass of my royal power, it is thine.”\\n\\nThis fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie. \\xa0He was\\nabout to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only\\ndone his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his\\nhead, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the\\ngracious offer--an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that\\nit was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import.\\n\\nMiles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, “Yes, that is\\nthe thing to do--by any other means it were impossible to get at it--and\\ncertes, this hour’s experience has taught me ’twould be most wearing and\\ninconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I will propose it; ’twas a\\nhappy accident that I did not throw the chance away.” \\xa0Then he dropped\\nupon one knee and said--\\n\\n“My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject’s simple duty,\\nand therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold\\nit worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this\\neffect. \\xa0Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being\\nill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was\\ndecreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so\\nsettle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God. \\xa0These two\\nkings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the\\nconflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he, that\\nour English knights refused to measure weapons with him. \\xa0So the matter,\\nwhich was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by\\ndefault. \\xa0Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in\\nEngland, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with\\nlong captivity. \\xa0Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth\\narrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge\\nframe and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king’s\\ncause was lost. \\xa0King John restored De Courcy’s titles and possessions,\\nand said, ‘Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half\\nmy kingdom;’ whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer,\\n‘This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and\\nhold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of\\nEngland, henceforth while the throne shall last.’ The boon was granted,\\nas your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred\\nyears, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day,\\nthe head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the\\nKing’s Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do.\\n{3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to\\ngrant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient\\nreward--and none other, to wit: \\xa0that I and my heirs, for ever, may\\n_sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England!”\\n\\n“Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,” said the King, gravely--giving the\\naccolade with Hendon’s sword--“rise, and seat thyself. \\xa0Thy petition is\\ngranted. \\xa0Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege\\nshall not lapse.”\\n\\nHis Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at\\ntable, observing to himself, “‘Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought\\nme a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not\\nthought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad’s\\nwits are cured.” \\xa0After a little, he went on, “And so I am become a\\nknight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange\\nposition, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I. \\xa0I will not laugh--no,\\nGod forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is _real_ to\\nhim. \\xa0And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects\\nwith truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.” \\xa0After\\na pause: “Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before\\nfolk!--there’d be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment! \\xa0But\\nno matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be\\ncontent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.\\n\\nA heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades. \\xa0The King\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Remove these rags.”--meaning his clothing.\\n\\nHendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in\\nbed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, “He hath\\ntaken my bed again, as before--marry, what shall _I_ do?” \\xa0The little\\nKing observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word. \\xa0He said,\\nsleepily--\\n\\n“Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.” \\xa0In a moment more he\\nwas out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.\\n\\n“Dear heart, he should have been born a king!” muttered Hendon,\\nadmiringly; “he playeth the part to a marvel.”\\n\\nThen he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying\\ncontentedly--\\n\\n“I have lodged worse for seven years; ’twould be but ill gratitude to\\nHim above to find fault with this.”\\n\\nHe dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. \\xa0Toward noon he rose, uncovered\\nhis unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took his measure with a\\nstring. \\xa0The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained\\nof the cold, and asked what he was doing.\\n\\n“‘Tis done, now, my liege,” said Hendon; “I have a bit of business\\noutside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needest it.\\nThere--let me cover thy head also--thou’lt be warm the sooner.”\\n\\nThe King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles\\nslipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of\\nthirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy’s\\nclothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and\\nsuited to the season of the year. \\xa0He seated himself, and began to\\noverhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--\\n\\n“A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the\\nlong purse one must be content with what a short one may do--\\n\\n“‘There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell--’\\n\\n“He stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; ’tis not\\ngood to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied\\nout, poor chap . . . This garment--‘tis well enough--a stitch here and\\nanother one there will set it aright. \\xa0This other is better, albeit a\\nstitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . _These_ be very\\ngood and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry--an odd new\\nthing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare,\\nwinters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one\\ngetteth a year’s sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle\\nwithout cost, for mere love. \\xa0Now shall I have the demon’s own time to\\nthread it!”\\n\\nAnd so he had. \\xa0He did as men have always done, and probably always will\\ndo, to the end of time--held the needle still, and tried to thrust the\\nthread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman’s way. \\xa0Time\\nand time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side\\nof the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the\\nshaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before,\\nwhen he was soldiering. \\xa0He succeeded at last, and took up the garment\\nthat had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.\\n\\n“The inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--and there is\\nwherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs\\nfor the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at\\nHendon Hall--\\n\\n“‘She loved her hus--’\\n\\n“Body o’ me! \\xa0I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters\\nlittle--‘tis not a novelty--yet ’tis not a convenience, neither. . . .\\nWe shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will\\nvanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--\\n\\n“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man--’\\n\\n“These be noble large stitches!”--holding the garment up and viewing\\nit admiringly--“they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause\\nthese small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and\\nplebeian--\\n\\n“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,--’\\n\\n“Marry, ’tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with\\nexpedition. \\xa0Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him,\\nand then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark\\nand--be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my\\nliege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith\\nhis slumber is deaf to speech. \\xa0What!”\\n\\nHe threw back the covers--the boy was gone!\\n\\nHe stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for\\nthe first time that his ward’s ragged raiment was also missing; then he\\nbegan to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper. \\xa0At that moment a\\nservant entered with the breakfast.\\n\\n“Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!” roared the man of\\nwar, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter\\ncould not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.\\n “Where is the boy?”\\n\\nIn disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information\\ndesired.\\n\\n“You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came\\nrunning and said it was your worship’s will that the boy come to you\\nstraight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side. \\xa0I brought him\\nhither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did\\ngrumble some little for being disturbed ‘so early,’ as he called it, but\\nstraightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying\\nit had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a\\nstranger--and so--”\\n\\n“And so thou’rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thy breed!\\nYet mayhap no hurt is done. \\xa0Possibly no harm is meant the boy. \\xa0I will\\ngo fetch him. \\xa0Make the table ready. \\xa0Stay! the coverings of the bed\\nwere disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?”\\n\\n“I know not, good your worship. \\xa0I saw the youth meddle with them--he\\nthat came for the boy.”\\n\\n“Thousand deaths!  ‘Twas done to deceive me--‘tis plain ’twas done to\\ngain time. \\xa0Hark ye! \\xa0Was that youth alone?”\\n\\n“All alone, your worship.”\\n\\n“Art sure?”\\n\\n“Sure, your worship.”\\n\\n“Collect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man.”\\n\\nAfter a moment’s thought, the servant said--\\n\\n“When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two\\nstepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out\\nfrom some near place; and just as he was joining them--”\\n\\n“What _then_?--out with it!” thundered the impatient Hendon,\\ninterrupting.\\n\\n“Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no\\nmore, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that\\nthe scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to\\nwitness that to blame _me_ for that miscarriage were like holding the\\nunborn babe to judgment for sins com--”\\n\\n“Out of my sight, idiot! \\xa0Thy prating drives me mad! \\xa0Hold! Whither art\\nflying? \\xa0Canst not bide still an instant? \\xa0Went they toward Southwark?”\\n\\n“Even so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to that detestable\\njoint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--”\\n\\n“Art here _yet_! \\xa0And prating still! \\xa0Vanish, lest I throttle thee!” The\\nservitor vanished. \\xa0Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged\\ndown the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, “‘Tis that scurvy\\nvillain that claimed he was his son. \\xa0I have lost thee, my poor little\\nmad master--it is a bitter thought--and I had come to love thee so! \\xa0No!\\nby book and bell, _not_ lost! \\xa0Not lost, for I will ransack the land\\ntill I find thee again. \\xa0Poor child, yonder is his breakfast--and mine,\\nbut I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it--speed, speed! that\\nis the word!” \\xa0As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes\\nupon the Bridge he several times said to himself--clinging to the\\nthought as if it were a particularly pleasing one--“He grumbled, but he\\n_went_--he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet\\nlad--he would ne’er have done it for another, I know it well.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV. ‘Le Roi est mort--vive le Roi.’\\n\\nToward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy\\nsleep and opened his eyes in the dark. \\xa0He lay silent a few moments,\\ntrying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some\\nsort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous\\nbut guarded voice--\\n\\n“I see it all, I see it all! \\xa0Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at\\nlast! \\xa0Come, joy! vanish, sorrow! \\xa0Ho, Nan! Bet! kick off your straw and\\nhie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the\\nwildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to\\nastonish the soul of man withal! . . . Ho, Nan, I say! \\xa0Bet!”\\n\\nA dim form appeared at his side, and a voice said--\\n\\n“Wilt deign to deliver thy commands?”\\n\\n“Commands? . . . O, woe is me, I know thy voice! \\xa0Speak thou--who am I?”\\n\\n“Thou? \\xa0In sooth, yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales; to-day art\\nthou my most gracious liege, Edward, King of England.”\\n\\nTom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring plaintively--\\n\\n“Alack, it was no dream! \\xa0Go to thy rest, sweet sir--leave me to my\\nsorrows.”\\n\\nTom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream. \\xa0He\\nthought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in the fair meadow\\ncalled Goodman’s Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, with long red\\nwhiskers and a humped back, appeared to him suddenly and said, “Dig by\\nthat stump.” \\xa0He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies--wonderful\\nriches! \\xa0Yet this was not the best of it; for the dwarf said--\\n\\n“I know thee. \\xa0Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy distresses\\nshall end, for the day of thy reward is come. \\xa0Dig here every seventh\\nday, and thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve bright new\\npennies. Tell none--keep the secret.”\\n\\nThen the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize,\\nsaying to himself, “Every night will I give my father a penny; he\\nwill think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more\\nbe beaten. One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall\\nhave; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four. We be done with hunger and\\nrags, now, done with fears and frets and savage usage.”\\n\\nIn his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but with\\neyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his\\nmother’s lap and cried out--\\n\\n“They are for thee!--all of them, every one!--for thee and Nan and\\nBet--and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!”\\n\\nThe happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“It waxeth late--may it please your Majesty to rise?”\\n\\nAh! that was not the answer he was expecting. \\xa0The dream had snapped\\nasunder--he was awake.\\n\\nHe opened his eyes--the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was\\nkneeling by his couch. \\xa0The gladness of the lying dream faded away--the\\npoor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king. \\xa0The room\\nwas filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles--the mourning\\ncolour--and with noble servants of the monarch. \\xa0Tom sat up in bed and\\ngazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.\\n\\nThe weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another\\nknelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences\\nupon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded. \\xa0In the beginning, a\\nshirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the\\nFirst Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of\\nthe Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest,\\nwho passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the\\nChancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master\\nof the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to\\nthe Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the\\nHousehold, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it\\nto the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of\\nCanterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took\\nwhat was left of it and put it on Tom. \\xa0Poor little wondering chap, it\\nreminded him of passing buckets at a fire.\\n\\nEach garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process;\\nconsequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt\\nan almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose\\nbegin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter\\nwas drawing near. \\xa0But he exulted too soon. \\xa0The First Lord of the\\nBedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom’s legs in them,\\nwhen a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things\\nback into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded\\nlook and a whispered, “See, my lord!” pointing to a something connected\\nwith the hose. \\xa0The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the\\nhose to the Lord High Admiral, whispering, “See, my lord!” \\xa0The Admiral\\npassed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had hardly breath\\nenough in his body to ejaculate, “See, my lord!” \\xa0The hose drifted\\nbackward along the line, to the Chief Steward of the Household, the\\nConstable of the Tower, Norroy King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe,\\nthe Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the\\nStole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the\\nBedchamber, the First Lord of the Buckhounds,--accompanied always with\\nthat amazed and frightened “See! see!”--till they finally reached the\\nhands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid\\nface, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely whispered,\\n“Body of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!--to the Tower with\\nthe Head Keeper of the King’s Hose!”--after which he leaned upon the\\nshoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished\\nstrength whilst fresh hose, without any damaged strings to them, were\\nbrought.\\n\\nBut all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in a\\ncondition to get out of bed. \\xa0The proper official poured water, the\\nproper official engineered the washing, the proper official stood by\\nwith a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage\\nand was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal. \\xa0When he at\\nlength emerged from this master’s hands, he was a gracious figure and\\nas pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and\\npurple-plumed cap. \\xa0He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room,\\nthrough the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these\\nfell back, leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees.\\n\\nAfter breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended by his\\ngreat officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt\\nbattle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to transact business\\nof state. \\xa0His ‘uncle,’ Lord Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to\\nassist the royal mind with wise counsel.\\n\\nThe body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors\\nappeared, to ask Tom’s approval of certain acts of theirs--rather a\\nform, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector as yet.\\n\\xa0The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council\\nof Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious\\nMajesty, and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors, to\\nwit: \\xa0the Archbishop of Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England;\\nWilliam Lord St. John; John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John\\nViscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham--\\n\\nTom was not listening--an earlier clause of the document was puzzling\\nhim. \\xa0At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford--\\n\\n“What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?”\\n\\n“The sixteenth of the coming month, my liege.”\\n\\n“‘Tis a strange folly. \\xa0Will he keep?”\\n\\nPoor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was used to\\nseeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a\\nvery different sort of expedition. \\xa0However, the Lord Hertford set his\\nmind at rest with a word or two.\\n\\nA secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the\\nmorrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and\\ndesired the King’s assent.\\n\\nTom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered--\\n\\n“Your Majesty will signify consent. \\xa0They come to testify their royal\\nmasters’ sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and\\nthe realm of England.”\\n\\nTom did as he was bidden. \\xa0Another secretary began to read a preamble\\nconcerning the expenses of the late King’s household, which had amounted\\nto 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months--a sum so vast that it\\nmade Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000\\npounds of this money was still owing and unpaid; {4} and once more when\\nit appeared that the King’s coffers were about empty, and his twelve\\nhundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. \\xa0Tom\\nspoke out, with lively apprehension--\\n\\n“We be going to the dogs, ’tis plain.  ‘Tis meet and necessary that we\\ntake a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no\\nvalue but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the\\nspirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath\\nnor brains nor hands to help itself withal. \\xa0I remember me of a small\\nhouse that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate--”\\n\\nA sharp pressure upon Tom’s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a\\nblush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this\\nstrange speech had been remarked or given concern.\\n\\nA secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in\\nhis will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and\\nraising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the peerage, and likewise\\nHertford’s son to an earldom, together with similar aggrandisements to\\nother great servants of the Crown, the Council had resolved to hold a\\nsitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of\\nthese honours, and that meantime, the late King not having granted,\\nin writing, estates suitable to the support of these dignities, the\\nCouncil, knowing his private wishes in that regard, had thought proper\\nto grant to Seymour ‘500 pound lands,’ and to Hertford’s son ‘800\\npound lands, and 300 pound of the next bishop’s lands which should fall\\nvacant,’--his present Majesty being willing. {5}\\n\\nTom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the\\nlate King’s debts first, before squandering all this money, but a\\ntimely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful Hertford, saved him\\nthis indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal assent, without spoken\\ncomment, but with much inward discomfort. \\xa0While he sat reflecting a\\nmoment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering\\nmiracles, a happy thought shot into his mind: \\xa0why not make his mother\\nDuchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate? \\xa0But a sorrowful\\nthought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave\\nveterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only\\nthe creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project\\nwith unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor.\\n\\nThe dull work went tediously on. \\xa0Petitions were read, and\\nproclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and\\nwearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed\\npathetically and murmured to himself, “In what have I offended, that the\\ngood God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the\\nsunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?”\\n \\xa0Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his\\nshoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want\\nof that august factor, the ratifying power. \\xa0Silence ensued around\\nthe slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their\\ndeliberations.\\n\\nDuring the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his\\nkeepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little\\nLady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued\\nby the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the\\nend of the visit his ‘elder sister’--afterwards the ‘Bloody Mary’ of\\nhistory--chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in\\nhis eyes, its brevity. \\xa0He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim\\nlad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose\\nclothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of\\nblack,--doublet, hose, and all. \\xa0He bore no badge of mourning but a knot\\nof purple ribbon on his shoulder. \\xa0He advanced hesitatingly, with head\\nbowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom sat still\\nand contemplated him soberly a moment. \\xa0Then he said--\\n\\n“Rise, lad. \\xa0Who art thou. \\xa0What wouldst have?”\\n\\nThe boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern\\nin his face. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord. \\xa0I am thy whipping-boy.”\\n\\n“My _whipping_-boy?”\\n\\n“The same, your Grace. \\xa0I am Humphrey--Humphrey Marlow.”\\n\\nTom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have\\nposted him about. \\xa0The situation was delicate. \\xa0What should he\\ndo?--pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his every utterance\\nthat he had never heard of him before? \\xa0No, that would not do. \\xa0An idea\\ncame to his relief: accidents like this might be likely to happen with\\nsome frequency, now that business urgencies would often call Hertford\\nand St. John from his side, they being members of the Council of\\nExecutors; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan\\nhimself to meet the requirements of such emergencies. \\xa0Yes, that would\\nbe a wise course--he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of\\nsuccess he might achieve. \\xa0So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment\\nor two, and presently said--\\n\\n“Now I seem to remember thee somewhat--but my wit is clogged and dim\\nwith suffering--”\\n\\n“Alack, my poor master!” ejaculated the whipping-boy, with feeling;\\nadding, to himself, “In truth ’tis as they said--his mind is gone--alas,\\npoor soul! \\xa0But misfortune catch me, how am I forgetting! \\xa0They said one\\nmust not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him.”\\n\\n“‘Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,” said Tom.\\n“But mind it not--I mend apace--a little clue doth often serve to bring\\nme back again the things and names which had escaped me. \\xa0(And not they,\\nonly, forsooth, but e’en such as I ne’er heard before--as this lad shall\\nsee.) \\xa0Give thy business speech.”\\n\\n“‘Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon it, an’ it\\nplease your Grace. \\xa0Two days gone by, when your Majesty faulted thrice\\nin your Greek--in the morning lessons,--dost remember it?”\\n\\n“Y-e-s--methinks I do. \\xa0(It is not much of a lie--an’ I had meddled with\\nthe Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but forty times.)\\nYes, I do recall it, now--go on.”\\n\\n“The master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish\\nwork, did promise that he would soundly whip me for it--and--”\\n\\n“Whip _thee_!” said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind. “Why\\nshould he whip _thee_ for faults of mine?”\\n\\n“Ah, your Grace forgetteth again. \\xa0He always scourgeth me when thou dost\\nfail in thy lessons.”\\n\\n“True, true--I had forgot. \\xa0Thou teachest me in private--then if I fail,\\nhe argueth that thy office was lamely done, and--”\\n\\n“Oh, my liege, what words are these? \\xa0I, the humblest of thy servants,\\npresume to teach _thee_?”\\n\\n“Then where is thy blame? \\xa0What riddle is this? \\xa0Am I in truth gone mad,\\nor is it thou? \\xa0Explain--speak out.”\\n\\n“But, good your Majesty, there’s nought that needeth simplifying.--None\\nmay visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows;\\nwherefore, when he faulteth, ’tis I that take them; and meet it is and\\nright, for that it is mine office and my livelihood.” {1}\\n\\nTom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, “Lo, it is a\\nwonderful thing,--a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have\\nnot hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me--would\\nheaven they would!--an’ they will do this thing, I will take my lashings\\nin mine own person, giving God thanks for the change.” Then he said\\naloud--\\n\\n“And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the promise?”\\n\\n“No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and\\nperadventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning\\nthat is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither\\nand remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my\\nbehalf--”\\n\\n“With the master? \\xa0To save thee thy whipping?”\\n\\n“Ah, thou dost remember!”\\n\\n“My memory mendeth, thou seest. \\xa0Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go\\nunscathed--I will see to it.”\\n\\n“Oh, thanks, my good lord!” cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again.\\n“Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--”\\n\\nSeeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he\\nwas “in the granting mood.”\\n\\n“Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart. \\xa0Sith thou art\\nno more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt,\\nwith none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt\\nlonger vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and\\nturn thy mind to things less irksome. Then am I ruined, and mine orphan\\nsisters with me!”\\n\\n“Ruined? \\xa0Prithee how?”\\n\\n“My back is my bread, O my gracious liege! if it go idle, I starve. \\xa0An’\\nthou cease from study mine office is gone thou’lt need no whipping-boy.\\nDo not turn me away!”\\n\\nTom was touched with this pathetic distress. \\xa0He said, with a right\\nroyal burst of generosity--\\n\\n“Discomfort thyself no further, lad. \\xa0Thine office shall be permanent in\\nthee and thy line for ever.” \\xa0Then he struck the boy a light blow on the\\nshoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, “Rise, Humphrey Marlow,\\nHereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England! \\xa0Banish\\nsorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they\\nmust in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine\\noffice be augmented.”\\n\\nThe grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--\\n\\n“Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass\\nmy most distempered dreams of fortune. \\xa0Now shall I be happy all my\\ndays, and all the house of Marlow after me.”\\n\\nTom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful\\nto him. \\xa0He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath.\\n\\xa0He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom’s ‘cure’; for\\nalways, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom’s diseased mind\\nthe various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal\\nschool-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then\\nable to ‘recall’ the circumstances quite clearly. \\xa0At the end of an\\nhour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information\\nconcerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he\\nresolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he\\nwould give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might\\ncome, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people.\\n\\xa0Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with\\nmore trouble for Tom.\\n\\nHe said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought\\nreport of the King’s damaged health might have leaked out and got\\nabroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to\\ndine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous\\nstep, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and\\ngrace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case\\nany evil rumours _had_ gone about--than any other scheme that could be\\ndevised.\\n\\nThen the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the\\nobservances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin\\ndisguise of ‘reminding’ him concerning things already known to him; but\\nto his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help\\nin this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for\\nHumphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine\\nin public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court.\\nTom kept these facts to himself, however.\\n\\nSeeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a\\nfew tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its\\namendment had progressed. \\xa0The results were happy, here and there, in\\nspots--spots where Humphrey’s tracks remained--and on the whole my lord\\nwas greatly pleased and encouraged. \\xa0So encouraged was he, indeed, that\\nhe spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--\\n\\n“Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet\\na little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss\\nwhich was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term\\nof service ended with our late lord’s life. May it please your Grace to\\nmake the trial?”\\n\\nTom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally\\nunacquainted with. \\xa0After a moment’s hesitation he looked up innocently\\nand asked--\\n\\n“What was it like, my lord?”\\n\\nThe Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, “Alack,\\nhis wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain\\nthem”--then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose\\nof sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom’s thoughts--a purpose which\\neasily succeeded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV. Tom as King.\\n\\nThe next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains;\\nand Tom, throned in awful state, received them. \\xa0The splendours of the\\nscene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but\\nthe audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the\\naddresses--wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and\\nhome-sickness by-and-by. \\xa0Tom said the words which Hertford put into\\nhis mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself\\nsatisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease\\nto accomplish more than a tolerable success. \\xa0He looked sufficiently\\nlike a king, but he was ill able to feel like one. \\xa0He was cordially\\nglad when the ceremony was ended.\\n\\nThe larger part of his day was ‘wasted’--as he termed it, in his own\\nmind--in labours pertaining to his royal office. \\xa0Even the two hours\\ndevoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a\\nburden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions\\nand ceremonious observances. \\xa0However, he had a private hour with\\nhis whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both\\nentertainment and needful information out of it.\\n\\nThe third day of Tom Canty’s kingship came and went much as the others\\nhad done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt\\nless uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his\\ncircumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the\\ntime; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and\\nembarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over\\nhis head.\\n\\nBut for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach\\nwithout serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that\\nday. There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day\\nhe would have to preside at a council which would take his views and\\ncommands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign\\nnations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too,\\nHertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector;\\nother things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to\\nTom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all\\nby himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a\\nmultitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon\\nhis mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any.\\n\\nStill, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came. \\xa0It found\\npoor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he\\ncould not shake it off. \\xa0The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon\\nhis hands, and wearied him. \\xa0Once more he felt the sense of captivity\\nheavy upon him.\\n\\nLate in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing\\nwith the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour\\nappointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great\\nofficials and courtiers.\\n\\nAfter a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become\\ninterested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the\\npalace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart\\nto take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting\\nand shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest\\nand poorest degree approaching from up the road.\\n\\n“I would I knew what ’tis about!” he exclaimed, with all a boy’s\\ncuriosity in such happenings.\\n\\n“Thou art the King!” solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.\\n“Have I your Grace’s leave to act?”\\n\\n“O blithely, yes! \\xa0O gladly, yes!” exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to\\nhimself with a lively sense of satisfaction, “In truth, being a king is\\nnot all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences.”\\n\\nThe Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with\\nthe order--\\n\\n“Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its\\nmovement. \\xa0By the King’s command!”\\n\\nA few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing\\nsteel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front\\nof the multitude. \\xa0A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were\\nfollowing a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes\\ncommitted against the peace and dignity of the realm.\\n\\nDeath--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates! \\xa0The thought\\nwrung Tom’s heart-strings. \\xa0The spirit of compassion took control of\\nhim, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of\\nthe offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals\\nhad inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the\\nscaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.\\n\\xa0His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the\\nfalse shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had\\nblurted out the command--\\n\\n“Bring them here!”\\n\\nThen he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but\\nobserving that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or\\nthe waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter. \\xa0The\\npage, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance\\nand retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command. \\xa0Tom\\nexperienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating\\nadvantages of the kingly office. He said to himself, “Truly it is like\\nwhat I was used to feel when I read the old priest’s tales, and did\\nimagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying\\n‘Do this, do that,’ whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my\\nwill.”\\n\\nNow the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was\\nannounced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was\\nquickly half-filled with noble folk and finery. \\xa0But Tom was hardly\\nconscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so\\nintensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter. \\xa0He seated\\nhimself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the\\ndoor with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the\\ncompany forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public\\nbusiness and court gossip one with another.\\n\\nIn a little while the measured tread of military men was heard\\napproaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an\\nunder-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king’s guard. \\xa0The civil\\nofficer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons\\nknelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom’s\\nchair. \\xa0Tom scanned the prisoners curiously. Something about the dress\\nor appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him.  “Methinks\\nI have seen this man ere now . . . but the when or the where fail\\nme.”--Such was Tom’s thought. Just then the man glanced quickly up and\\nquickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port\\nof sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was\\nsufficient. \\xa0He said to himself: “Now is the matter clear; this is the\\nstranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life,\\nthat windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity\\nhe hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case . . . I\\nhave not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after,\\nupon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer\\nCanty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that\\nwent before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by\\ncomparison.”\\n\\nTom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence\\nfor a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--\\n\\n“Good sir, what is this man’s offence?”\\n\\nThe officer knelt, and answered--\\n\\n“So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison.”\\n\\nTom’s compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring\\nrescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock.\\n\\n“The thing was proven upon him?” he asked.\\n\\n“Most clearly, sire.”\\n\\nTom sighed, and said--\\n\\n“Take him away--he hath earned his death.  ‘Tis a pity, for he was a\\nbrave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the _look_ of it!”\\n\\nThe prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung\\nthem despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the ‘King’\\nin broken and terrified phrases--\\n\\n“O my lord the King, an’ thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me! \\xa0I\\nam innocent--neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than\\nbut lamely proved--yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth\\nagainst me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a\\nboon, for my doom is more than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the\\nKing! in thy royal compassion grant my prayer--give commandment that I\\nbe hanged!”\\n\\nTom was amazed. \\xa0This was not the outcome he had looked for.\\n\\n“Odds my life, a strange _boon_! \\xa0Was it not the fate intended thee?”\\n\\n“O good my liege, not so! \\xa0It is ordered that I be _boiled alive_!”\\n\\nThe hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his\\nchair. \\xa0As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out--\\n\\n“Have thy wish, poor soul! an’ thou had poisoned a hundred men thou\\nshouldst not suffer so miserable a death.”\\n\\nThe prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate\\nexpressions of gratitude--ending with--\\n\\n“If ever thou shouldst know misfortune--which God forefend!--may thy\\ngoodness to me this day be remembered and requited!”\\n\\nTom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said--\\n\\n“My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man’s\\nferocious doom?”\\n\\n“It is the law, your Grace--for poisoners. \\xa0In Germany coiners be boiled\\nto death in _oil_--not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into\\nthe oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then--”\\n\\n“O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!” cried Tom, covering\\nhis eyes with his hands to shut out the picture.  “I beseech your good\\nlordship that order be taken to change this law--oh, let no more poor\\ncreatures be visited with its tortures.”\\n\\nThe Earl’s face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of\\nmerciful and generous impulses--a thing not very common with his class\\nin that fierce age. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“These your Grace’s noble words have sealed its doom. \\xa0History will\\nremember it to the honour of your royal house.”\\n\\nThe under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign\\nto wait; then he said--\\n\\n“Good sir, I would look into this matter further. \\xa0The man has said his\\ndeed was but lamely proved. \\xa0Tell me what thou knowest.”\\n\\n“If the King’s grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this\\nman entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay\\nsick--three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and\\ntwo say it was some minutes later--the sick man being alone at the time,\\nand sleeping--and presently the man came forth again and went his\\nway. \\xa0The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and\\nretchings.”\\n\\n“Did any see the poison given? \\xa0Was poison found?”\\n\\n“Marry, no, my liege.”\\n\\n“Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?”\\n\\n“Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such\\nsymptoms but by poison.”\\n\\nWeighty evidence, this, in that simple age. \\xa0Tom recognised its\\nformidable nature, and said--\\n\\n“The doctor knoweth his trade--belike they were right. \\xa0The matter hath\\nan ill-look for this poor man.”\\n\\n“Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many\\ntestified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither,\\ndid foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick\\nman _would die by poison_--and more, that a stranger would give it--a\\nstranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and\\nsurely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill. \\xa0Please your\\nMajesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due,\\nseeing it was _foretold_.”\\n\\nThis was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day. \\xa0Tom\\nfelt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this\\npoor fellow’s guilt was proved. \\xa0Still he offered the prisoner a chance,\\nsaying--\\n\\n“If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.”\\n\\n“Nought that will avail, my King. \\xa0I am innocent, yet cannot I make\\nit appear. \\xa0I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in\\nIslington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I\\nwas above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more,\\nmy King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was _taking_ life, I\\nwas _saving_ it. \\xa0A drowning boy--”\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!”\\n\\n“At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New\\nYear, most illustrious--”\\n\\n“Let the prisoner go free--it is the King’s will!”\\n\\nAnother blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his\\nindecorum as well as he could by adding--\\n\\n“It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained\\nevidence!”\\n\\nA low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. \\xa0It was not\\nadmiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the\\npropriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing\\nwhich few there would have felt justified in either admitting or\\nadmiring--no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which\\nTom had displayed. \\xa0Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect--\\n\\n“This is no mad king--he hath his wits sound.”\\n\\n“How sanely he put his questions--how like his former natural self was\\nthis abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!”\\n\\n“God be thanked, his infirmity is spent! \\xa0This is no weakling, but a\\nking. \\xa0He hath borne himself like to his own father.”\\n\\nThe air being filled with applause, Tom’s ear necessarily caught a\\nlittle of it. \\xa0The effect which this had upon him was to put him\\ngreatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying\\nsensations.\\n\\nHowever, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant\\nthoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief\\nthe woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command,\\nthe two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.\\n\\n“What is it that these have done?” he inquired of the sheriff.\\n\\n“Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly\\nproven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that\\nthey be hanged. \\xa0They sold themselves to the devil--such is their\\ncrime.”\\n\\nTom shuddered. \\xa0He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked\\nthing. \\xa0Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding\\nhis curiosity for all that; so he asked--\\n\\n“Where was this done?--and when?”\\n\\n“On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.”\\n\\nTom shuddered again.\\n\\n“Who was there present?”\\n\\n“Only these two, your grace--and _that other_.”\\n\\n“Have these confessed?”\\n\\n“Nay, not so, sire--they do deny it.”\\n\\n“Then prithee, how was it known?”\\n\\n“Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this\\nbred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified\\nit. \\xa0In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so\\nobtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the\\nregion round about. \\xa0Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and\\nsooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it,\\nsith all had suffered by it.”\\n\\n“Certes this is a serious matter.” \\xa0Tom turned this dark piece of\\nscoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked--\\n\\n“Suffered the woman also by the storm?”\\n\\nSeveral old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of\\nthe wisdom of this question. \\xa0The sheriff, however, saw nothing\\nconsequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness--\\n\\n“Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her\\nhabitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.”\\n\\n“Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She\\nhad been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid\\nher soul, and her child’s, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she\\nknoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.”\\n\\nThe elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom’s wisdom once more, and one\\nindividual murmured, “An’ the King be mad himself, according to report,\\nthen is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I\\nwot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.”\\n\\n“What age hath the child?” asked Tom.\\n\\n“Nine years, please your Majesty.”\\n\\n“By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself,\\nmy lord?” asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.\\n\\n“The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty\\nmatter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope\\nwith the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders. \\xa0The\\n_Devil_ may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto,\\nbut not an Englishman--in this latter case the contract would be null\\nand void.”\\n\\n“It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English\\nlaw denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!” cried\\nTom, with honest heat.\\n\\nThis novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored\\naway in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom’s\\noriginality as well as progress toward mental health.\\n\\nThe elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom’s\\nwords with an excited interest and a growing hope. \\xa0Tom noticed this,\\nand it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and\\nunfriended situation. \\xa0Presently he asked--\\n\\n“How wrought they to bring the storm?”\\n\\n“_By pulling off their stockings_, sire.”\\n\\nThis astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He\\nsaid, eagerly--\\n\\n“It is wonderful! \\xa0Hath it always this dread effect?”\\n\\n“Always, my liege--at least if the woman desire it, and utter the\\nneedful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.”\\n\\nTom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal--\\n\\n“Exert thy power--I would see a storm!”\\n\\nThere was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and\\na general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place--all of\\nwhich was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed\\ncataclysm. \\xa0Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman’s face, he\\nadded, excitedly--\\n\\n“Never fear--thou shalt be blameless. \\xa0More--thou shalt go free--none\\nshall touch thee. \\xa0Exert thy power.”\\n\\n“Oh, my lord the King, I have it not--I have been falsely accused.”\\n\\n“Thy fears stay thee. \\xa0Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.\\n\\xa0Make a storm--it mattereth not how small a one--I require nought great\\nor harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite--do this and thy life is\\nspared--thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King’s\\npardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.”\\n\\nThe woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had\\nno power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child’s life\\nalone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King’s\\ncommand so precious a grace might be acquired.\\n\\nTom urged--the woman still adhered to her declarations. \\xa0Finally he\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I think the woman hath said true. \\xa0An’ _my_ mother were in her place\\nand gifted with the devil’s functions, she had not stayed a moment to\\ncall her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my\\nforfeit life were the price she got! \\xa0It is argument that other\\nmothers are made in like mould. \\xa0Thou art free, goodwife--thou and thy\\nchild--for I do think thee innocent. \\xa0_Now_ thou’st nought to fear,\\nbeing pardoned--pull off thy stockings!--an’ thou canst make me a storm,\\nthou shalt be rich!”\\n\\nThe redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to\\nobey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred\\nby apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided\\ndiscomfort and uneasiness. \\xa0The woman stripped her own feet and her\\nlittle girl’s also, and plainly did her best to reward the King’s\\ngenerosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a\\ndisappointment. \\xa0Tom sighed, and said--\\n\\n“There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed\\nout of thee. \\xa0Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time,\\nforget me not, but fetch me a storm.” {13}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI. The State Dinner.\\n\\nThe dinner hour drew near--yet strangely enough, the thought brought\\nbut slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror. \\xa0The morning’s\\nexperiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little\\nash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four\\ndays’ habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month. \\xa0A\\nchild’s facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more\\nstrikingly illustrated.\\n\\nLet us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a\\nglance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the\\nimposing occasion. \\xa0It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars\\nand pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings. \\xa0At the door stand tall\\nguards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes,\\nand bearing halberds. \\xa0In a high gallery which runs all around the place\\nis a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes,\\nin brilliant attire. \\xa0In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform,\\nis Tom’s table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:\\n\\n“A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another\\nbearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times\\nwith the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after\\nkneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod\\nagain, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have\\nkneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the\\ntable, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first;\\nat last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife,\\nwho, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful\\nmanner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe\\nas if the King had been present.” {6}\\n\\nSo end the solemn preliminaries. \\xa0Now, far down the echoing corridors\\nwe hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, “Place for the King!\\n\\xa0Way for the King’s most excellent majesty!” \\xa0These sounds are momently\\nrepeated--they grow nearer and nearer--and presently, almost in our\\nfaces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, “Way for the King!”\\n \\xa0At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door,\\nwith a measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:--\\n\\n“First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly\\ndressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of\\nwhich carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red\\nscabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next\\ncomes the King himself--whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and\\nmany drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the\\ngalleries rise in their places, crying ‘God save the King!’ \\xa0After him\\ncome nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his\\nguard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes.”\\n\\nThis was all fine and pleasant. \\xa0Tom’s pulse beat high, and a glad light\\nwas in his eye. \\xa0He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more\\nso because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being\\ncharmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him--and\\nbesides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful\\nclothes after he has grown a little used to them--especially if he is\\nfor the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and\\nacknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head,\\nand a courteous “I thank ye, my good people.”\\n\\nHe seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without\\nthe least embarrassment; for to eat with one’s cap on was the one\\nsolitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon\\ncommon ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the\\nmatter of old familiarity with it. \\xa0The pageant broke up and grouped\\nitself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.\\n\\nNow to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,--“the\\ntallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in\\nthis regard”--but we will let the chronicler tell about it:--\\n\\n“The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with\\ngolden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each\\nturn a course of dishes, served in plate. \\xa0These dishes were received\\nby a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon\\nthe table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the\\nparticular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison.”\\n\\nTom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds\\nof eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an\\ninterest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly\\nexplosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about\\nthe place. \\xa0He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do\\nanything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt\\ndown and did it for him. \\xa0He got through without a mistake--flawless and\\nprecious triumph.\\n\\nWhen the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his\\nbright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles,\\nrolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen\\nthe worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad\\nto endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself\\nfree from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII. Foo-foo the First.\\n\\nMiles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge,\\nkeeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and\\nexpecting to overtake them presently. \\xa0He was disappointed in this,\\nhowever. \\xa0By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the\\nway through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as\\nto how to proceed. \\xa0Still, he continued his efforts as best he\\ncould during the rest of the day. \\xa0Nightfall found him leg-weary,\\nhalf-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so\\nhe supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early\\nstart in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. \\xa0As he lay\\nthinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: \\xa0The boy would\\nescape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go\\nback to London and seek his former haunts? \\xa0No, he would not do that,\\nhe would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? \\xa0Never having had a\\nfriend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would\\nnaturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not\\nrequire him to go toward London and danger. \\xa0He would strike for Hendon\\nHall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound\\nand there he might expect to find him. \\xa0Yes, the case was plain to\\nHendon--he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through\\nKent, toward Monk’s Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went.\\n\\xa0Let us return to the vanished little King now.\\n\\nThe ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw ‘about to join’\\nthe youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close\\nbehind them and followed their steps. \\xa0He said nothing. His left arm was\\nin a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped\\nslightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. \\xa0The youth led the King\\na crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the\\nhigh road beyond. \\xa0The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop\\nhere--it was Hendon’s place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. \\xa0He\\nwould not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. \\xa0The youth\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Thou’lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder?\\n\\xa0So be it, then.”\\n\\nThe King’s manner changed at once. \\xa0He cried out--\\n\\n“Wounded? \\xa0And who hath dared to do it? \\xa0But that is apart; lead on,\\nlead on! \\xa0Faster, sirrah! \\xa0Art shod with lead? \\xa0Wounded, is he? \\xa0Now\\nthough the doer of it be a duke’s son he shall rue it!”\\n\\nIt was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.\\nThe youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground,\\nwith a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest,\\nwatching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were\\nevidently guides to the point he was aiming at. \\xa0By-and-by an open place\\nwas reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near\\nthem a barn which was falling to ruin and decay. \\xa0There was no sign of\\nlife anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. \\xa0The youth entered the barn,\\nthe King following eagerly upon his heels. \\xa0No one there! The King shot\\na surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked--\\n\\n“Where is he?”\\n\\nA mocking laugh was his answer. \\xa0The King was in a rage in a moment; he\\nseized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth\\nwhen another mocking laugh fell upon his ear. \\xa0It was from the lame\\nruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said\\nangrily--\\n\\n“Who art thou? \\xa0What is thy business here?”\\n\\n“Leave thy foolery,” said the man, “and quiet thyself. \\xa0My disguise is\\nnone so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through\\nit.”\\n\\n“Thou art not my father. \\xa0I know thee not. \\xa0I am the King. \\xa0If thou hast\\nhid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou\\nhast done.”\\n\\nJohn Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice--\\n\\n“It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; \\xa0but if thou\\nprovoke me, I must. \\xa0Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are\\nno ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy\\ntongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change.\\n\\xa0I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home--neither shalt thou,\\nseeing I need thy service. \\xa0My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is\\nHobbs--John Hobbs; thine is Jack--charge thy memory accordingly. \\xa0Now,\\nthen, speak. \\xa0Where is thy mother? \\xa0Where are thy sisters? \\xa0They came\\nnot to the place appointed--knowest thou whither they went?”\\n\\nThe King answered sullenly--\\n\\n“Trouble me not with these riddles. \\xa0My mother is dead; my sisters are\\nin the palace.”\\n\\nThe youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have\\nassaulted him, but Canty--or Hobbs, as he now called himself--prevented\\nhim, and said--\\n\\n“Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.\\nSit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat,\\nanon.”\\n\\nHobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King\\nremoved himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company.\\n\\xa0He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where\\nhe found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw. \\xa0He lay down\\nhere, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed\\nin thinking. \\xa0He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost\\ninto forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father. \\xa0To\\nthe rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and\\nsuggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand\\ndealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only\\nsensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that\\nwas all gentleness and affection. \\xa0He called to mind a long succession\\nof loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon\\nthem, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that\\npossessed his heart. As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with\\nhis troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.\\n\\nAfter a considerable time--he could not tell how long--his senses\\nstruggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes\\nvaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a\\nmurmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense\\nof comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment,\\nby a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter. \\xa0It startled him\\ndisagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption\\nproceeded. \\xa0A grim and unsightly picture met his eye. \\xa0A bright fire was\\nburning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and\\naround it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the\\nmotliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he\\nhad ever read or dreamed of. \\xa0There were huge stalwart men, brown\\nwith exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were\\nmiddle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there\\nwere blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones,\\nwith wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping\\nfrom ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with\\nhis pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the\\nimplements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls,\\nsome were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud,\\nbrazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three\\nsore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings\\nabout their necks, whose office was to lead the blind.\\n\\nThe night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was\\nbeginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general\\ncry broke forth--\\n\\n“A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!”\\n\\nOne of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches\\nthat sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which\\nrecited the cause of his calamity. \\xa0Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself\\nof his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs,\\nbeside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty,\\nand were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in\\na rousing chorus. \\xa0By the time the last stanza was reached, the\\nhalf-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined\\nin and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of\\nvillainous sound that made the rafters quake. \\xa0These were the inspiring\\nwords:--\\n\\n‘Bien Darkman’s then, Bouse Mort and Ken, The bien Coves bings awast, On\\nChates to trine by Rome Coves dine For his long lib at last. Bing’d out\\nbien Morts and toure, and toure, Bing out of the Rome vile bine, And\\ntoure the Cove that cloy’d your duds, Upon the Chates to trine.’\\n\\n(From’The English Rogue.’ London, 1665.)\\n\\nConversation followed; not in the thieves’ dialect of the song, for that\\nwas only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening. \\xa0In the\\ncourse of it, it appeared that ‘John Hobbs’ was not altogether a new\\nrecruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time. \\xa0His later\\nhistory was called for, and when he said he had ‘accidentally’ killed a\\nman, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the\\nman was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with\\neverybody. \\xa0Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were\\nproud to shake him by the hand. \\xa0He was asked why he had ’tarried away\\nso many months.’ \\xa0He answered--\\n\\n“London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the\\nlaws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. \\xa0An’ I had not had that\\naccident, I had stayed there. \\xa0I had resolved to stay, and never more\\nventure country-wards--but the accident has ended that.”\\n\\nHe inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. \\xa0The ‘ruffler,’ or\\nchief, answered--\\n\\n“Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and\\nmaunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. {7} \\xa0Most are\\nhere, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow\\nat dawn.”\\n\\n“I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me. \\xa0Where may he be?”\\n\\n“Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate\\ntaste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer.”\\n\\n“I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave.”\\n\\n“That was he, truly. \\xa0Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on\\nthe eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none\\never seeing her drunk above four days in the seven.”\\n\\n“She was ever strict--I remember it well--a goodly wench and worthy\\nall commendation. \\xa0Her mother was more free and less particular; a\\ntroublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above\\nthe common.”\\n\\n“We lost her through it. \\xa0Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of\\nfortune-telling begot for her at last a witch’s name and fame. The\\nlaw roasted her to death at a slow fire. \\xa0It did touch me to a sort of\\ntenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot--cursing and reviling\\nall the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked\\nupward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about\\nher old gray head--cursing them! why an’ thou should’st live a thousand\\nyears thoud’st never hear so masterful a cursing. \\xa0Alack, her art died\\nwith her. \\xa0There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true\\nblasphemy.”\\n\\nThe Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general\\ndepression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened\\noutcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to\\nfeel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and\\nunder peculiarly favouring circumstances--as in cases like to this, for\\ninstance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir. \\xa0However, a\\ndeep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.\\n\\n“Have any others of our friends fared hardly?” asked Hobbs.\\n\\n“Some--yes. \\xa0Particularly new comers--such as small husbandmen turned\\nshiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from\\nthem to be changed to sheep ranges. \\xa0They begged, and were whipped at\\nthe cart’s tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set\\nin the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and\\ndeprived of an ear; they begged a third time--poor devils, what else\\ncould they do?--and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then\\nsold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged.  ‘Tis\\na brief tale, and quickly told. \\xa0Others of us have fared less hardly.\\nStand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge--show your adornments!”\\n\\nThese stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their\\nbacks, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned\\nup his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another\\nshowed a brand upon his shoulder--the letter V--and a mutilated ear; the\\nthird said--\\n\\n“I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and\\nkids--now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife\\nand kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in--in the other\\nplace--but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in _England_!\\n\\xa0My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick;\\none of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for\\na witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed. \\xa0English law!--up,\\nall, with your cups!--now all together and with a cheer!--drink to the\\nmerciful English law that delivered _her_ from the English hell! \\xa0Thank\\nyou, mates, one and all. \\xa0I begged, from house to house--I and the\\nwife--bearing with us the hungry kids--but it was crime to be hungry in\\nEngland--so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns. \\xa0Drink\\nye all again to the merciful English law!--for its lash drank deep of my\\nMary’s blood and its blessed deliverance came quick. \\xa0She lies there, in\\nthe potter’s field, safe from all harms. \\xa0And the kids--well, whilst\\nthe law lashed me from town to town, they starved. Drink, lads--only\\na drop--a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm.\\n\\xa0I begged again--begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an\\near--see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump\\nof the other to keep me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was\\nsold for a slave--here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off,\\nye might see the red S the branding-iron left there! \\xa0A _slave_! \\xa0Do\\nyou understand that word? \\xa0An English _slave_!--that is he that stands\\nbefore ye. \\xa0I have run from my master, and when I am found--the heavy\\ncurse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!--I\\nshall hang!” {1}\\n\\nA ringing voice came through the murky air--\\n\\n“Thou shalt _not_!--and this day the end of that law is come!”\\n\\nAll turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching\\nhurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a\\ngeneral explosion of inquiries broke out--\\n\\n“Who is it? \\xa0_What_ is it? \\xa0Who art thou, manikin?”\\n\\nThe boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and\\nquestioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity--\\n\\n“I am Edward, King of England.”\\n\\nA wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of\\ndelight in the excellence of the joke. \\xa0The King was stung. \\xa0He said\\nsharply--\\n\\n“Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I\\nhave promised?”\\n\\nHe said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in\\na whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.  ‘John Hobbs’ made\\nseveral attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last\\nsucceeded--saying--\\n\\n“Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad--mind him not--he\\nthinketh he _is_ the King.”\\n\\n“I _am_ the King,” said Edward, turning toward him, “as thou shalt know\\nto thy cost, in good time. \\xa0Thou hast confessed a murder--thou shalt\\nswing for it.”\\n\\n“_Thou’lt_ betray me?--_thou_? \\xa0An’ I get my hands upon thee--”\\n\\n“Tut-tut!” said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the\\nKing, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist,\\n“hast respect for neither Kings _nor_ Rufflers? \\xa0An’ thou insult my\\npresence so again, I’ll hang thee up myself.” \\xa0Then he said to his\\nMajesty, “Thou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou\\nmust guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere. \\xa0_Be king_, if\\nit please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it. \\xa0Sink the title thou\\nhast uttered--‘tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but\\nnone among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving\\nand loyal hearts, in that regard. \\xa0Note if I speak truth. \\xa0Now--all\\ntogether:  ‘Long live Edward, King of England!’”\\n\\n“LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!”\\n\\nThe response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the\\ncrazy building vibrated to the sound. \\xa0The little King’s face lighted\\nwith pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and\\nsaid with grave simplicity--\\n\\n“I thank you, my good people.”\\n\\nThis unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.\\nWhen something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said,\\nfirmly, but with an accent of good nature--\\n\\n“Drop it, boy, ’tis not wise, nor well. \\xa0Humour thy fancy, if thou must,\\nbut choose some other title.”\\n\\nA tinker shrieked out a suggestion--\\n\\n“Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!”\\n\\nThe title ’took,’ at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout\\nwent up, of--\\n\\n“Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!” followed by\\nhootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.\\n\\n“Hale him forth, and crown him!”\\n\\n“Robe him!”\\n\\n“Sceptre him!”\\n\\n“Throne him!”\\n\\nThese and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the\\npoor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin,\\nrobed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with\\nthe tinker’s soldering-iron. \\xa0Then all flung themselves upon their\\nknees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking\\nsupplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and\\nragged sleeves and aprons--\\n\\n“Be gracious to us, O sweet King!”\\n\\n“Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!”\\n\\n“Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!”\\n\\n“Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of\\nsovereignty!”\\n\\n“Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the\\ndirt and be ennobled!”\\n\\n“Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children’s children may tell of\\nthy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!”\\n\\nBut the humorous tinker made the ‘hit’ of the evening and carried off\\nthe honours. \\xa0Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King’s foot, and was\\nindignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste\\nover the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying\\nit must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he\\nshould make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to\\nview at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight. \\xa0He made himself so\\nkillingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy\\nrabble.\\n\\nTears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch’s eyes; and\\nthe thought in his heart was, “Had I offered them a deep wrong they\\ncould not be more cruel--yet have I proffered nought but to do them a\\nkindness--and it is thus they use me for it!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII. The Prince with the Tramps.\\n\\nThe troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on\\ntheir march. \\xa0There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under\\nfoot, and a winter chill in the air. \\xa0All gaiety was gone from the\\ncompany; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant,\\nnone were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.\\n\\nThe Ruffler put ‘Jack’ in Hugo’s charge, with some brief instructions,\\nand commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he\\nalso warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.\\n\\nAfter a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.\\nThe troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. \\xa0They\\ngrew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and\\ninsult passengers along the highway. \\xa0This showed that they were awaking\\nto an appreciation of life and its joys once more. \\xa0The dread in which\\ntheir sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them\\nthe road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing\\nto talk back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full\\nview of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that\\nthey did not take the hedges, too.\\n\\nBy-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home\\nwhile the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to\\nfurnish a breakfast for them. \\xa0They chucked the housewife and her\\ndaughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and\\nmade coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and\\nbursts of horse-laughter. \\xa0They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer\\nand his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously\\nwhen a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of\\nthe daughters who resented some of their familiarities. \\xa0When they took\\ntheir leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the\\nheads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the\\nauthorities.\\n\\nAbout noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind\\na hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village. \\xa0An hour was allowed\\nfor rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village\\nat different points to ply their various trades--‘Jack’ was sent with\\nHugo. \\xa0They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching\\nfor opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none--so he\\nfinally said--\\n\\n“I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. \\xa0Wherefore we will beg.”\\n\\n“_We_, forsooth! \\xa0Follow thy trade--it befits thee. \\xa0But _I_ will not\\nbeg.”\\n\\n“Thou’lt not beg!” exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.\\n“Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?”\\n\\n“What dost thou mean?”\\n\\n“Mean? \\xa0Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?”\\n\\n“I? \\xa0Thou idiot!”\\n\\n“Spare thy compliments--thy stock will last the longer. \\xa0Thy father says\\nthou hast begged all thy days. \\xa0Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will\\neven make so bold as to _say_ he lied,” scoffed Hugo.\\n\\n“Him _you_ call my father? \\xa0Yes, he lied.”\\n\\n“Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy\\namusement, not thy hurt. \\xa0An’ I tell him this, he will scorch thee\\nfinely for it.”\\n\\n“Save thyself the trouble. \\xa0I will tell him.”\\n\\n“I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.\\nBone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going\\nout of one’s way to invite them. \\xa0But a truce to these matters; _I_\\nbelieve your father. \\xa0I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he _doth_\\nlie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion\\nhere. \\xa0A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for\\nnought. \\xa0But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging,\\nwherewithal shall we busy ourselves? \\xa0With robbing kitchens?”\\n\\nThe King said, impatiently--\\n\\n“Have done with this folly--you weary me!”\\n\\nHugo replied, with temper--\\n\\n“Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I\\nwill tell you what you _will_ do. \\xa0You will play decoy whilst _I_ beg.\\nRefuse, an’ you think you may venture!”\\n\\nThe King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,\\ninterrupting--\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0Here comes one with a kindly face. \\xa0Now will I fall down in\\na fit. \\xa0When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon\\nyour knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery\\nwere in your belly, and say, ‘Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother,\\nand we be friendless; o’ God’s name cast through your merciful eyes one\\npitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow\\none little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready\\nto perish!’--and mind you, keep you _on_ wailing, and abate not till we\\nbilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it.”\\n\\nThen immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and\\nreel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he\\nsprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in\\nthe dirt, in seeming agony.\\n\\n“O, dear, O dear!” cried the benevolent stranger, “O poor soul, poor\\nsoul, how he doth suffer! \\xa0There--let me help thee up.”\\n\\n“O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman--but it\\ngiveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so. \\xa0My brother there\\nwill tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be\\nupon me. \\xa0A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave\\nme to my sorrows.”\\n\\n“A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,”--and he fumbled\\nin his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. “There, poor lad,\\ntake them and most welcome. \\xa0Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry\\nthy stricken brother to yon house, where--”\\n\\n“I am not his brother,” said the King, interrupting.\\n\\n“What! not his brother?”\\n\\n“Oh, hear him!” groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. “He\\ndenies his own brother--and he with one foot in the grave!”\\n\\n“Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother. \\xa0For\\nshame!--and he scarce able to move hand or foot. \\xa0If he is not thy\\nbrother, who is he, then?”\\n\\n“A beggar and a thief! \\xa0He has got your money and has picked your pocket\\nlikewise. \\xa0An’ thou would’st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over\\nhis shoulders and trust Providence for the rest.”\\n\\nBut Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. \\xa0In a moment he was up and off\\nlike the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry\\nlustily as he went. \\xa0The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for\\nhis own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken\\nhis pace until he was out of harm’s reach. \\xa0He took the first road that\\noffered, and soon put the village behind him. \\xa0He hurried along, as\\nbriskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over\\nhis shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful\\nsense of security took their place. \\xa0He recognised, now, that he was\\nhungry, and also very tired. \\xa0So he halted at a farmhouse; but when\\nhe was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away. \\xa0His\\nclothes were against him.\\n\\nHe wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself\\nin the way of like treatment no more. \\xa0But hunger is pride’s master; so,\\nas the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but\\nhere he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was\\npromised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.\\n\\nThe night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch\\nlaboured slowly on. \\xa0He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he\\nsat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold. \\xa0All\\nhis sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom\\nand the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him. \\xa0At\\nintervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and\\nas he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of\\nformless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about\\nit all that made him shudder. \\xa0Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a\\nlight--always far away, apparently--almost in another world; if he heard\\nthe tinkle of a sheep’s bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct;\\nthe muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in\\nvanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining\\nhowl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds\\nwere remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity\\nwere far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in\\nthe centre of a measureless solitude.\\n\\nHe stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new\\nexperience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves\\noverhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he\\ncame suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. \\xa0He\\nstepped back into the shadows and waited. \\xa0The lantern stood by the\\nopen door of a barn. \\xa0The King waited some time--there was no sound,\\nand nobody stirring. \\xa0He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable\\nbarn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and\\nenter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing\\nthe threshold he heard voices behind him. \\xa0He darted behind a cask,\\nwithin the barn, and stooped down. \\xa0Two farm-labourers came in, bringing\\nthe lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. \\xa0Whilst they\\nmoved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took\\nthe bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end\\nof the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to\\nhimself. \\xa0He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway\\nof the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the\\ncrown of England for one night.\\n\\nBy-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind\\nthem and taking the lantern with them. \\xa0The shivering King made for the\\nblankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them\\nup, and then groped his way safely to the stall. \\xa0Of two of the blankets\\nhe made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. \\xa0He was a\\nglad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite\\nwarm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost\\nsuffocatingly powerful.\\n\\nAlthough the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so\\ndrowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage\\nof the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of\\nsemi-consciousness. \\xa0Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself\\nwholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! \\xa0He was broad awake in\\na moment, and gasping for breath. \\xa0The cold horror of that mysterious\\ntouch in the dark almost made his heart stand still. \\xa0He lay motionless,\\nand listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was\\nno sound. \\xa0He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long\\ntime, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. \\xa0So he began\\nto drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that\\nmysterious touch again! \\xa0It was a grisly thing, this light touch from\\nthis noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly\\nfears. \\xa0What should he do? \\xa0That was the question; but he did not know\\nhow to answer it. \\xa0Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters\\nand fly from this inscrutable horror? \\xa0But fly whither? \\xa0He could\\nnot get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and\\nthither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this\\nphantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch\\nupon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable. \\xa0But to stay\\nwhere he was, and endure this living death all night--was that better?\\n\\xa0No. \\xa0What, then, was there left to do? \\xa0Ah, there was but one course;\\nhe knew it well--he must put out his hand and find that thing!\\n\\nIt was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try\\nit. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,\\ngingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp--not because it\\nhad encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just\\n_going_ to. \\xa0But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his\\nhand lightly swept against something soft and warm. \\xa0This petrified him,\\nnearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine\\nthe thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.\\nHe thought he would rather die than touch it again. \\xa0But he thought this\\nfalse thought because he did not know the immortal strength of\\nhuman curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping\\nagain--against his judgment, and without his consent--but groping\\npersistently on, just the same. \\xa0It encountered a bunch of long hair; he\\nshuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm\\nrope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!--for the rope was\\nnot a rope at all, but the calf’s tail.\\n\\nThe King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that\\nfright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he\\nneed not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened\\nhim, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and\\nany other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and\\nsuffered just as he had done.\\n\\nThe King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a\\ncalf, but delighted to have the calf’s company; for he had been feeling\\nso lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even\\nthis humble animal were welcome. \\xa0And he had been so buffeted, so rudely\\nentreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel\\nthat he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at\\nleast a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes\\nmight be lacking. \\xa0So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with\\nthe calf.\\n\\nWhile stroking its sleek warm back--for it lay near him and within easy\\nreach--it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways\\nthan one. \\xa0Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to\\nthe calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf’s back, drew the covers\\nup over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and\\ncomfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace\\nof Westminster.\\n\\nPleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming. \\xa0He\\nwas free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship\\nof base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he\\nwas happy. \\xa0The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts\\nthat made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down\\nat intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and\\nprojections--but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and\\ncomfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan\\nand wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it. \\xa0He merely snuggled\\nthe closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted\\nblissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that\\nwas full of serenity and peace. \\xa0The distant dogs howled, the melancholy\\nkine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets\\nof rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on,\\nundisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and\\nnot easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX. The Prince with the peasants.\\n\\nWhen the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but\\nthoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy\\nbed for itself in his bosom. \\xa0Being disturbed now, it scampered away.\\nThe boy smiled, and said, “Poor fool, why so fearful? \\xa0I am as forlorn\\nas thou.  ‘Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so\\nhelpless. \\xa0Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king\\nhas fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely\\nmeaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no\\nlower go.”\\n\\nHe got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound\\nof children’s voices. \\xa0The barn door opened and a couple of little girls\\ncame in. \\xa0As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and\\nthey stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they\\npresently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and\\nstopped again to gaze and whisper. \\xa0By-and-by they gathered courage and\\nbegan to discuss him aloud. \\xa0One said--\\n\\n“He hath a comely face.”\\n\\nThe other added--\\n\\n“And pretty hair.”\\n\\n“But is ill clothed enow.”\\n\\n“And how starved he looketh.”\\n\\nThey came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining\\nhim minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of\\nanimal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he\\nmight be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion. \\xa0Finally they\\nhalted before him, holding each other’s hands for protection, and took a\\ngood satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked\\nup all her courage and inquired with honest directness--\\n\\n“Who art thou, boy?”\\n\\n“I am the King,” was the grave answer.\\n\\nThe children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide\\nopen and remained so during a speechless half minute. \\xa0Then curiosity\\nbroke the silence--\\n\\n“The _King_? \\xa0What King?”\\n\\n“The King of England.”\\n\\nThe children looked at each other--then at him--then at each other\\nagain--wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said--\\n\\n“Didst hear him, Margery?--he said he is the King. \\xa0Can that be true?”\\n\\n“How can it be else but true, Prissy? \\xa0Would he say a lie? \\xa0For look\\nyou, Prissy, an’ it were not true, it _would_ be a lie. \\xa0It surely would\\nbe. Now think on’t. \\xa0For all things that be not true, be lies--thou\\ncanst make nought else out of it.”\\n\\nIt was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left\\nPrissy’s half-doubts not a leg to stand on. \\xa0She considered a moment,\\nthen put the King upon his honour with the simple remark--\\n\\n“If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee.”\\n\\n“I am truly the King.”\\n\\nThis settled the matter. \\xa0His Majesty’s royalty was accepted without\\nfurther question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once\\nto inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so\\nunroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs. \\xa0It\\nwas a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not\\nbe scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting\\neven his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and\\ntenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. \\xa0But when he got down\\nto his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without\\nfood, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a\\nbreakfast for him.\\n\\nThe King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, “When I\\nam come to mine own again, I will always honour little children,\\nremembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time\\nof trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser,\\nmocked at me and held me for a liar.”\\n\\nThe children’s mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity;\\nfor his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her\\nwomanly heart. \\xa0She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had\\nseen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate. \\xa0She\\nimagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or\\nkeepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that\\nshe might take measures to return him; but all her references to\\nneighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line\\nwent for nothing--the boy’s face, and his answers, too, showed that the\\nthings she was talking of were not familiar to him. \\xa0He spoke earnestly\\nand simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when\\nspeaking of the late King ‘his father’; but whenever the conversation\\nchanged to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.\\n\\nThe woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up. \\xa0As she\\nproceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to\\nsurprise the boy into betraying his real secret. \\xa0She talked about\\ncattle--he showed no concern; then about sheep--the same result: \\xa0so\\nher guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about\\nmills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all\\nsorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: \\xa0but no\\nmatter, she was baffled at all points. \\xa0Not altogether, either; for she\\nargued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service. \\xa0Yes,\\nshe was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house\\nservant. \\xa0So she led up to that. \\xa0But the result was discouraging. The\\nsubject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir\\nhim; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,\\nwith a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject\\nof cooking. \\xa0To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King’s face\\nlighted at once! \\xa0Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and\\nshe was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had\\naccomplished it.\\n\\nHer tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King’s, inspired\\nby gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering\\npots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an\\neloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three\\nminutes the woman said to herself, “Of a truth I was right--he hath\\nholpen in a kitchen!” \\xa0Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed\\nit with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to\\nherself, “Good lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones\\nwithal? \\xa0For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great.\\n\\xa0Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the\\npalace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the\\nvery kitchen of the King himself! \\xa0I will test him.”\\n\\nFull of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the\\ncooking a moment--hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or\\ntwo, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a\\nsign to follow after. \\xa0The King muttered--\\n\\n“Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone\\ntime--it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the\\ngreat Alfred stooped to assume. \\xa0But I will try to better serve my trust\\nthan he; for he let the cakes burn.”\\n\\nThe intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for\\nthis King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning\\nhis vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted--the cookery got\\nburned. The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire\\ndestruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a\\nbrisk and cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was\\nover his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and\\ngentleness toward him.\\n\\nThe boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and\\ngladdened by it. \\xa0It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious\\nfeature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient\\nof the favour was aware that it had been extended. \\xa0The goodwife had\\nintended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner,\\nlike any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the\\nscolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it\\nby allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on\\nostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was\\nso remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so\\nkind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself\\nto the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to\\nstand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary\\nstate due to his birth and dignity. \\xa0It does us all good to unbend\\nsometimes. \\xa0This good woman was made happy all the day long by the\\napplauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension\\nto a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious\\nhumility toward a humble peasant woman.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the\\ndishes. \\xa0This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came\\nnear rebelling; but then he said to himself, “Alfred the Great watched\\nthe cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too--therefore will\\nI essay it.”\\n\\nHe made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the\\ncleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.\\nIt was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it\\nat last. \\xa0He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now;\\nhowever, he was not to lose this thrifty dame’s society so easily. \\xa0She\\nfurnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got\\nthrough with after a fair fashion and with some credit. \\xa0Then she set\\nhim and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so\\nawkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a\\nbutcher knife to grind.\\n\\nAfterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid\\nthe good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in\\nthe matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in\\nstory-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. \\xa0And\\nwhen, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket\\nof kittens to drown, he did resign. \\xa0At least he was just going to\\nresign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it\\nseemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right\\nthing--when there was an interruption. \\xa0The interruption was John\\nCanty--with a peddler’s pack on his back--and Hugo.\\n\\nThe King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they\\nhad had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line,\\nbut took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way,\\nwithout a word. \\xa0He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on,\\ninto a narrow lane at the rear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX. The Prince and the hermit.\\n\\nThe high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of\\na deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the\\ndistance. \\xa0He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter\\nof the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.\\nThat was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but\\nhurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the\\ntwilight depths of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he\\nwas now tolerably safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was\\nprofound and solemn--awful, even, and depressing to the spirits. \\xa0At\\nwide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so\\nremote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real\\nsounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed\\nones. \\xa0So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they\\ninterrupted.\\n\\nIt was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of\\nthe day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at\\nlast obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight\\nthrough the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was\\ndisappointed in this. \\xa0He travelled on and on; but the farther he went,\\nthe denser the wood became, apparently. \\xa0The gloom began to thicken,\\nby-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on. \\xa0It made\\nhim shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he\\ntried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could\\nnot now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he\\nkept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.\\n\\nAnd how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He\\napproached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen. \\xa0It\\ncame from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut. \\xa0He heard\\na voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his\\nmind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently. \\xa0He glided to the\\none window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance\\nwithin. \\xa0The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten\\nhard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or\\ntwo; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans;\\nthere was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the\\nremains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was\\nlighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box\\nat his side lay an open book and a human skull. \\xa0The man was of large,\\nbony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he\\nwas clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his\\nheels.\\n\\n“A holy hermit!” said the King to himself; “now am I indeed fortunate.”\\n\\nThe hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. \\xa0A deep voice\\nresponded--\\n\\n“Enter!--but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand\\nis holy!”\\n\\nThe King entered, and paused. \\xa0The hermit turned a pair of gleaming,\\nunrestful eyes upon him, and said--\\n\\n“Who art thou?”\\n\\n“I am the King,” came the answer, with placid simplicity.\\n\\n“Welcome, King!” cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. \\xa0Then, bustling\\nabout with feverish activity, and constantly saying, “Welcome, welcome,”\\n he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some\\nfaggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous\\nstride.\\n\\n“Welcome! \\xa0Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy,\\nand were turned away. \\xa0But a King who casts his crown away, and despises\\nthe vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to\\ndevote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh--he is\\nworthy, he is welcome!--here shall he abide all his days till death\\ncome.” \\xa0The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid\\nno attention to him--did not even hear him, apparently, but went right\\non with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy.  “And thou\\nshalt be at peace here. \\xa0None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee\\nwith supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God\\nhath moved thee to abandon. \\xa0Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the\\nBook; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world,\\nand upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon\\ncrusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the\\npurifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin;\\nthou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at\\npeace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he\\nshall not find thee, he shall not molest thee.”\\n\\nThe old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and\\nbegan to mutter. \\xa0The King seized this opportunity to state his case;\\nand he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension.\\n\\xa0But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed. \\xa0And still\\nmuttering, he approached the King and said impressively--\\n\\n“‘Sh! \\xa0I will tell you a secret!” \\xa0He bent down to impart it, but\\nchecked himself, and assumed a listening attitude. \\xa0After a moment\\nor two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and\\npeered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his\\nface close down to the King’s, and whispered--\\n\\n“I am an archangel!”\\n\\nThe King started violently, and said to himself, “Would God I were with\\nthe outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!” \\xa0His\\napprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face. \\xa0In\\na low excited voice the hermit continued--\\n\\n“I see you feel my atmosphere! \\xa0There’s awe in your face! \\xa0None may\\nbe in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very\\natmosphere of heaven. \\xa0I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an\\neye. \\xa0I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago,\\nby angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity. \\xa0Their presence\\nfilled this place with an intolerable brightness. \\xa0And they knelt to me,\\nKing! yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. \\xa0I have walked\\nin the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs. \\xa0Touch\\nmy hand--be not afraid--touch it. \\xa0There--now thou hast touched a hand\\nwhich has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! \\xa0For I have\\nwalked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!” \\xa0He\\npaused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and\\nhe started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, “Yes, I am an\\narchangel; _a mere archangel!_--I that might have been pope! \\xa0It is\\nverily true. \\xa0I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago;\\nah, yes, I was to be pope!--and I _should_ have been pope, for Heaven\\nhad said it--but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor\\nobscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my\\nmighty destiny!” Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in\\nfutile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse,\\nand now and then a pathetic “Wherefore I am nought but an archangel--I\\nthat should have been pope!”\\n\\nSo he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and\\nsuffered. Then all at once the old man’s frenzy departed, and he became\\nall gentleness. \\xa0His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and\\nfell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the\\nKing’s heart completely. \\xa0The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the\\nfire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions\\nwith a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a\\nsupper--chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the\\nlad’s cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in\\na little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were\\nchanged to reverence and affection for the man.\\n\\nThis happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then,\\nafter a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a\\nsmall adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother\\nmight; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the\\nfire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.\\nPresently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his\\nfingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his\\nmind. \\xa0Apparently he was unsuccessful. \\xa0Now he started quickly up, and\\nentered his guest’s room, and said--\\n\\n“Thou art King?”\\n\\n“Yes,” was the response, drowsily uttered.\\n\\n“What King?”\\n\\n“Of England.”\\n\\n“Of England? \\xa0Then Henry is gone!”\\n\\n“Alack, it is so. \\xa0I am his son.”\\n\\nA black frown settled down upon the hermit’s face, and he clenched his\\nbony hands with a vindictive energy. \\xa0He stood a few moments, breathing\\nfast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice--\\n\\n“Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and\\nhomeless?”\\n\\nThere was no response. \\xa0The old man bent down and scanned the boy’s\\nreposeful face and listened to his placid breathing.  “He sleeps--sleeps\\nsoundly;” and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of\\nevil satisfaction. \\xa0A smile flitted across the dreaming boy’s features.\\nThe hermit muttered, “So--his heart is happy;” and he turned away. \\xa0He\\nwent stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;\\nnow and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around\\nand casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always\\nmumbling to himself. \\xa0At last he found what he seemed to want--a rusty\\nold butcher knife and a whetstone. \\xa0Then he crept to his place by the\\nfire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone,\\nstill muttering, mumbling, ejaculating. \\xa0The winds sighed around the\\nlonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the\\ndistances. \\xa0The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at\\nthe old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt,\\nabsorbed, and noted none of these things.\\n\\nAt long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and\\nnodded his head with satisfaction.  “It grows sharper,” he said; “yes,\\nit grows sharper.”\\n\\nHe took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,\\nentertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in\\narticulate speech--\\n\\n“His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us--and is gone down into the\\neternal fires! \\xa0Yes, down into the eternal fires! \\xa0He escaped us--but it\\nwas God’s will, yes it was God’s will, we must not repine. \\xa0But he\\nhath not escaped the fires! \\xa0No, he hath not escaped the fires, the\\nconsuming, unpitying, remorseless fires--and _they_ are everlasting!”\\n\\nAnd so he wrought, and still wrought--mumbling, chuckling a low rasping\\nchuckle at times--and at times breaking again into words--\\n\\n“It was his father that did it all. \\xa0I am but an archangel; but for him\\nI should be pope!”\\n\\nThe King stirred. \\xa0The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and\\nwent down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife\\nuplifted. \\xa0The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but\\nthere was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his\\ntranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.\\n\\nThe hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and\\nscarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept\\naway, saying,--\\n\\n“It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest\\nby accident someone be passing.”\\n\\nHe glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and\\nanother one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling\\nhe managed to tie the King’s ankles together without waking him. \\xa0Next\\nhe essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them,\\nbut the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was\\nready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready\\nto despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment\\nthey were bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper’s chin and\\nbrought up over his head and tied fast--and so softly, so gradually,\\nand so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy\\nslept peacefully through it all without stirring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI. Hendon to the rescue.\\n\\nThe old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the\\nlow bench. \\xa0He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and\\nflickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving\\neyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there,\\nheedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled\\nand chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as\\na grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay\\nbound and helpless in his web.\\n\\nAfter a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,--yet not seeing,\\nhis mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,--observed, on a\\nsudden, that the boy’s eyes were open! wide open and staring!--staring\\nup in frozen horror at the knife. \\xa0The smile of a gratified devil crept\\nover the old man’s face, and he said, without changing his attitude or\\nhis occupation--\\n\\n“Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?”\\n\\nThe boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced\\na smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to\\ninterpret as an affirmative answer to his question.\\n\\n“Then pray again. \\xa0Pray the prayer for the dying!”\\n\\nA shudder shook the boy’s frame, and his face blenched. \\xa0Then he\\nstruggled again to free himself--turning and twisting himself this way\\nand that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately--but uselessly--to\\nburst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him,\\nand nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time\\nto time, “The moments are precious, they are few and precious--pray the\\nprayer for the dying!”\\n\\nThe boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles,\\npanting. \\xa0The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down\\nhis face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the\\nsavage old man.\\n\\nThe dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply,\\nwith a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice--\\n\\n“I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! \\xa0The night is already gone. \\xa0It\\nseems but a moment--only a moment; would it had endured a year! \\xa0Seed of\\nthe Church’s spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an’ thou fearest to look\\nupon--”\\n\\nThe rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. \\xa0The old man sank upon his\\nknees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.\\n\\nHark! \\xa0There was a sound of voices near the cabin--the knife dropped\\nfrom the hermit’s hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up,\\ntrembling. \\xa0The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough\\nand angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift\\nfootsteps, retreating. \\xa0Immediately came a succession of thundering\\nknocks upon the cabin door, followed by--\\n\\n“Hullo-o-o! \\xa0Open! \\xa0And despatch, in the name of all the devils!”\\n\\nOh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King’s\\nears; for it was Miles Hendon’s voice!\\n\\nThe hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of\\nthe bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King\\nheard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the ‘chapel’:--\\n\\n“Homage and greeting, reverend sir! \\xa0Where is the boy--_my_ boy?”\\n\\n“What boy, friend?”\\n\\n“What boy! \\xa0Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I am not\\nin the humour for it. \\xa0Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I\\njudged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was\\nat large again, and they had tracked him to your door. \\xa0They showed me\\nhis very footprints. \\xa0Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an’\\nthou produce him not--Where is the boy?”\\n\\n“O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried\\nhere the night. \\xa0If such as you take an interest in such as he, know,\\nthen, that I have sent him of an errand. \\xa0He will be back anon.”\\n\\n“How soon? \\xa0How soon? \\xa0Come, waste not the time--cannot I overtake him?\\nHow soon will he be back?”\\n\\n“Thou need’st not stir; he will return quickly.”\\n\\n“So be it, then. \\xa0I will try to wait. \\xa0But stop!--_you_ sent him of an\\nerrand?--you! \\xa0Verily this is a lie--he would not go. \\xa0He would pull thy\\nold beard, an’ thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied,\\nfriend; thou hast surely lied! \\xa0He would not go for thee, nor for any\\nman.”\\n\\n“For any _man_--no; haply not. \\xa0But I am not a man.”\\n\\n“_What_! \\xa0Now o’ God’s name what art thou, then?”\\n\\n“It is a secret--mark thou reveal it not. \\xa0I am an archangel!”\\n\\nThere was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon--not altogether\\nunprofane--followed by--\\n\\n“This doth well and truly account for his complaisance! \\xa0Right well\\nI knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any\\nmortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the\\nword o’ command! \\xa0Let me--‘sh! \\xa0What noise was that?”\\n\\nAll this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with\\nterror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown\\nall the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly\\nexpecting them to reach Hendon’s ear, but always realising, with\\nbitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression. \\xa0So this\\nlast remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh\\nfields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his\\nenergy, just as the hermit was saying--\\n\\n“Noise? \\xa0I heard only the wind.”\\n\\n“Mayhap it was. \\xa0Yes, doubtless that was it. \\xa0I have been hearing it\\nfaintly all the--there it is again! \\xa0It is not the wind! \\xa0What an odd\\nsound! \\xa0Come, we will hunt it out!”\\n\\nNow the King’s joy was nearly insupportable. \\xa0His tired lungs did\\ntheir utmost--and hopefully, too--but the sealed jaws and the muffling\\nsheepskin sadly crippled the effort. \\xa0Then the poor fellow’s heart sank,\\nto hear the hermit say--\\n\\n“Ah, it came from without--I think from the copse yonder. \\xa0Come, I will\\nlead the way.”\\n\\nThe King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die\\nquickly away--then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.\\n\\nIt seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching\\nagain--and this time he heard an added sound,--the trampling of hoofs,\\napparently. \\xa0Then he heard Hendon say--\\n\\n“I will not wait longer. \\xa0I _cannot_ wait longer. \\xa0He has lost his way\\nin this thick wood. \\xa0Which direction took he? \\xa0Quick--point it out to\\nme.”\\n\\n“He--but wait; I will go with thee.”\\n\\n“Good--good! \\xa0Why, truly thou art better than thy looks. \\xa0Marry I do\\nnot think there’s not another archangel with so right a heart as thine.\\n\\xa0Wilt ride? \\xa0Wilt take the wee donkey that’s for my boy, or wilt thou\\nfork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have\\nprovided for myself?--and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the\\nindifferent sum of a month’s usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker\\nout of work.”\\n\\n“No--ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and\\nwill walk.”\\n\\n“Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my\\nhands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one.”\\n\\nThen followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings,\\naccompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and\\nfinally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its\\nspirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment.\\n\\nWith unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and\\nfootsteps fade away and die out. \\xa0All hope forsook him, now, for the\\nmoment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart. “My only friend\\nis deceived and got rid of,” he said; “the hermit will return and--” \\xa0He\\nfinished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with\\nhis bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin.\\n\\nAnd now he heard the door open! \\xa0The sound chilled him to the\\nmarrow--already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat. \\xa0Horror made\\nhim close his eyes; horror made him open them again--and before him\\nstood John Canty and Hugo!\\n\\nHe would have said “Thank God!” if his jaws had been free.\\n\\nA moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each\\ngripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the\\nforest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII. A Victim of Treachery.\\n\\nOnce more ‘King Foo-foo the First’ was roving with the tramps and\\noutlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and\\nsometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and\\nHugo when the Ruffler’s back was turned. \\xa0None but Canty and Hugo really\\ndisliked him. \\xa0Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck\\nand spirit. \\xa0During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge\\nthe King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable;\\nand at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by\\nputting small indignities upon him--always as if by accident. \\xa0Twice he\\nstepped upon the King’s toes--accidentally--and the King, as became his\\nroyalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but\\nthe third time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled\\nhim to the ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe.\\n\\xa0Hugo, consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and\\ncame at his small adversary in a fury. \\xa0Instantly a ring was formed\\naround the gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.\\n\\nBut poor Hugo stood no chance whatever. \\xa0His frantic and lubberly\\n‘prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against\\nan arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in\\nsingle-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick of swordsmanship.\\n\\xa0The little King stood, alert but at graceful ease, and caught and\\nturned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which\\nset the motley on-lookers wild with admiration; and every now and then,\\nwhen his practised eye detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap\\nupon Hugo’s head followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter\\nthat swept the place was something wonderful to hear. \\xa0At the end of\\nfifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for\\na pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the\\nunscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the\\nshoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the\\nRuffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks;\\nhis meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled,\\nand a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who\\nshould thenceforth utter it.\\n\\nAll attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed. He\\nhad stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape.\\n\\xa0He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his\\nreturn; he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the\\nhousemates. He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work;\\nhe would not work; moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own\\nsoldering-iron; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their\\nhands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away. \\xa0He\\ndelivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered\\nhis liberties or tried to force him to service. \\xa0He was sent out, in\\nHugo’s charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby,\\nto beg; but the result was not encouraging--he declined to plead for the\\nmendicants, or be a party to their cause in any way.\\n\\nThus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and\\nthe weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became\\ngradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at\\nlast to feel that his release from the hermit’s knife must prove only a\\ntemporary respite from death, at best.\\n\\nBut at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was\\non his throne, and master again. \\xa0This, of course, intensified the\\nsufferings of the awakening--so the mortifications of each succeeding\\nmorning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the\\ncombat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to\\nbear.\\n\\nThe morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with\\nvengeful purposes against the King. \\xa0He had two plans, in particular.\\nOne was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit\\nand ‘imagined’ royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to\\naccomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the\\nKing, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law.\\n\\nIn pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a ‘clime’ upon the\\nKing’s leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and\\nperfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get\\nCanty’s help, and _force_ the King to expose his leg in the highway\\nand beg for alms.  ‘Clime’ was the cant term for a sore, artificially\\ncreated. To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of\\nunslaked lime, soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a\\npiece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg. \\xa0This would\\npresently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking;\\nblood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a\\ndark and repulsive colour. \\xa0Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in\\na cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen,\\nand move the compassion of the passer-by. {8}\\n\\nHugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the\\nsoldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon\\nas they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker\\nheld him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg.\\n\\nThe King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the\\nsceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him\\nand enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats. \\xa0This\\ncontinued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work\\nwould have been perfected, if there had been no interruption. \\xa0But there\\nwas; for about this time the ‘slave’ who had made the speech denouncing\\nEngland’s laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise,\\nand stripped off the poultice and bandage.\\n\\nThe King wanted to borrow his deliverer’s cudgel and warm the jackets\\nof the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring\\ntrouble--leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together,\\nthen, the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt. \\xa0He\\nmarched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler,\\nwho listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be\\nagain detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something\\nhigher and better--wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the\\nmendicant rank and appointed him to steal!\\n\\nHugo was overjoyed. \\xa0He had already tried to make the King steal, and\\nfailed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of\\ncourse the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered\\ndirectly from head-quarters. \\xa0So he planned a raid for that very\\nafternoon, purposing to get the King in the law’s grip in the course of\\nit; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem\\nto be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was\\npopular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular\\nmember who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him\\nover to the common enemy, the law.\\n\\nVery well. \\xa0All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village\\nwith his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after\\nanother, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil\\npurpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and\\nget free of his infamous captivity for ever.\\n\\nBoth threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both,\\nin their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this\\ntime, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into\\nany venture that had much uncertainty about it.\\n\\nHugo’s chance came first. \\xa0For at last a woman approached who carried a\\nfat package of some sort in a basket. \\xa0Hugo’s eyes sparkled with sinful\\npleasure as he said to himself, “Breath o’ my life, an’ I can but\\nput _that_ upon him, ’tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the\\nGame-Cocks!” He waited and watched--outwardly patient, but inwardly\\nconsuming with excitement--till the woman had passed by, and the time\\nwas ripe; then said, in a low voice--\\n\\n“Tarry here till I come again,” and darted stealthily after the prey.\\n\\nThe King’s heart was filled with joy--he could make his escape, now, if\\nHugo’s quest only carried him far enough away.\\n\\nBut he was to have no such luck. \\xa0Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched\\nthe package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of\\nblanket which he carried on his arm. \\xa0The hue and cry was raised in a\\nmoment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden,\\nalthough she had not seen the pilfering done. \\xa0Hugo thrust the bundle\\ninto the King’s hands without halting, saying--\\n\\n“Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry ‘Stop thief!’ but mind ye\\nlead them astray!”\\n\\nThe next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked\\nalley--and in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking\\ninnocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch\\nresults.\\n\\nThe insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell\\naway from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her\\nheels; she seized the King’s wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle\\nwith the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy\\nwhile he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip.\\n\\nHugo had seen enough--his enemy was captured and the law would get him,\\nnow--so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards,\\nframing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler’s crew\\nas he strode along.\\n\\nThe King continued to struggle in the woman’s strong grasp, and now and\\nthen cried out in vexation--\\n\\n“Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of\\nthy paltry goods.”\\n\\nThe crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a\\nbrawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows,\\nmade a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson;\\nbut just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing\\nforce upon the man’s arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it\\nremarking pleasantly, at the same time--\\n\\n“Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and\\nuncharitable words. \\xa0This is matter for the law’s consideration,\\nnot private and unofficial handling. \\xa0Loose thy hold from the boy,\\ngoodwife.”\\n\\nThe blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went\\nmuttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy’s wrist\\nreluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently\\nclosed their mouths. \\xa0The King sprang to his deliverer’s side, with\\nflushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming--\\n\\n“Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir\\nMiles; carve me this rabble to rags!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.\\n\\nHendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King’s\\near--\\n\\n“Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily--nay, suffer it not to\\nwag at all. \\xa0Trust in me--all shall go well in the end.” Then he added\\nto himself:  “_Sir_ Miles! \\xa0Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a\\nknight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth\\ntake upon his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title\\nis mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is\\nmore honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of\\nDreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of\\nthe _real_ kingdoms of this world.”\\n\\nThe crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about\\nto lay his hand upon the King’s shoulder, when Hendon said--\\n\\n“Gently, good friend, withhold your hand--he shall go peaceably; I am\\nresponsible for that. \\xa0Lead on, we will follow.”\\n\\nThe officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King\\nfollowed after, with the crowd at their heels. \\xa0The King was inclined to\\nrebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice--\\n\\n“Reflect, Sire--your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty;\\nshall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect\\nthem? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on\\nhis throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was\\nseemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and\\nsubmitted to its authority?”\\n\\n“Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King\\nof England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself\\nsuffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.”\\n\\nWhen the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the\\npeace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who\\nhad committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so\\nthe King stood convicted. \\xa0The bundle was now unrolled, and when the\\ncontents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked\\ntroubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an\\nelectric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected\\nby his ignorance. \\xa0The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then\\nturned to the woman, with the question--\\n\\n“What dost thou hold this property to be worth?”\\n\\nThe woman courtesied and replied--\\n\\n“Three shillings and eightpence, your worship--I could not abate a penny\\nand set forth the value honestly.”\\n\\nThe justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to\\nthe constable, and said--\\n\\n“Clear the court and close the doors.”\\n\\nIt was done. \\xa0None remained but the two officials, the accused, the\\naccuser, and Miles Hendon. \\xa0This latter was rigid and colourless, and\\non his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended\\ntogether, and trickled down his face. \\xa0The judge turned to the woman\\nagain, and said, in a compassionate voice--\\n\\n“‘Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for\\nthese be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an\\nevil face--but when hunger driveth--Good woman! dost know that when one\\nsteals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha’penny the law saith\\nhe shall _hang_ for it?”\\n\\nThe little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled\\nhimself and held his peace; but not so the woman. \\xa0She sprang to her\\nfeet, shaking with fright, and cried out--\\n\\n“Oh, good lack, what have I done! \\xa0God-a-mercy, I would not hang\\nthe poor thing for the whole world! \\xa0Ah, save me from this, your\\nworship--what shall I do, what _can_ I do?”\\n\\nThe justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said--\\n\\n“Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ\\nupon the record.”\\n\\n“Then in God’s name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day\\nthat freed my conscience of this awesome thing!”\\n\\nMiles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King\\nand wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging\\nhim. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig;\\nand when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into\\nthe narrow hall. \\xa0The justice proceeded to write in his record book.\\n\\xa0Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer\\nfollowed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and\\nlistened. \\xa0He heard a conversation to this effect--\\n\\n“It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here\\nis the eightpence.”\\n\\n“Eightpence, indeed! \\xa0Thou’lt do no such thing. \\xa0It cost me three\\nshillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old\\nHarry that’s just dead ne’er touched or tampered with. \\xa0A fig for thy\\neightpence!”\\n\\n“Stands the wind in that quarter? \\xa0Thou wast under oath, and so swore\\nfalsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence. \\xa0Come straightway\\nback with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!--and then the\\nlad will hang.”\\n\\n“There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. \\xa0Give me the\\neightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.”\\n\\nThe woman went off crying: \\xa0Hendon slipped back into the court room,\\nand the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some\\nconvenient place. \\xa0The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King\\na wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment\\nin the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging. \\xa0The astounded\\nKing opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to\\nbe beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and\\nsucceeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.\\nHendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the\\ntwo departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. \\xa0The moment\\nthe street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his\\nhand, and exclaimed--\\n\\n“Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail _alive_?”\\n\\nHendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply--\\n\\n“_Will_ you trust in me? \\xa0Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with\\ndangerous speech. \\xa0What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it,\\nthou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient--‘twill be time\\nenow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.” {1}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV. The Escape.\\n\\nThe short winter day was nearly ended. \\xa0The streets were deserted, save\\nfor a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the\\nintent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands\\nas quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising\\nwind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to\\nthe left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem\\nto see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his\\nway to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.\\nBy-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and\\nproceeded to cross it. \\xa0When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon\\nlaid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice--\\n\\n“Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a\\nword to thee.”\\n\\n“My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.”\\n\\n“Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly. \\xa0Turn thy back\\na moment and seem not to see: \\xa0_let this poor lad escape_.”\\n\\n“This to me, sir! \\xa0I arrest thee in--”\\n\\n“Nay, be not too hasty. \\xa0See thou be careful and commit no foolish\\nerror,”--then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man’s\\near--“the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck,\\nman!”\\n\\nThe poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then\\nfound his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon\\nwas tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee\\ncome to harm. \\xa0Observe, I heard it all--every word. \\xa0I will prove it to\\nthee.” Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman\\nhad had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--\\n\\n“There--have I set it forth correctly? \\xa0Should not I be able to set it\\nforth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?”\\n\\nThe man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied,\\nand said with forced lightness--\\n\\n“‘Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the\\nwoman for mine amusement.”\\n\\n“Kept you the woman’s pig for amusement?”\\n\\nThe man answered sharply--\\n\\n“Nought else, good sir--I tell thee ’twas but a jest.”\\n\\n“I do begin to believe thee,” said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of\\nmockery and half-conviction in his tone; “but tarry thou here a\\nmoment whilst I run and ask his worship--for nathless, he being a man\\nexperienced in law, in jests, in--”\\n\\nHe was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted,\\nspat out an oath or two, then cried out--\\n\\n“Hold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge! \\xa0Why, man, he\\nhath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we\\nwill speak further. \\xa0Ods body! \\xa0I seem to be in evil case--and all for\\nan innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my\\nwife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst\\nthou of me?”\\n\\n“Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a\\nhundred thousand--counting slowly,” said Hendon, with the expression of\\na man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.\\n\\n“It is my destruction!” said the constable despairingly.  “Ah, be\\nreasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and\\nsee how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how plainly it is so. \\xa0And\\neven if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that\\ne’en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and\\nwarning from the judge’s lips.”\\n\\nHendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--\\n\\n“This jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?”\\n\\n“I knew it not! \\xa0Peradventure I have been unwise. \\xa0I never dreamed it\\nhad a name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.”\\n\\n“Yes, it hath a name. \\xa0In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis\\nlex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.”\\n\\n“Ah, my God!”\\n\\n“And the penalty is death!”\\n\\n“God be merciful to me a sinner!”\\n\\n“By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy,\\nthou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha’penny, paying but\\na trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive\\nbarratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem\\nexpurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without\\nransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.”\\n\\n“Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! \\xa0Be thou\\nmerciful--spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought\\nthat shall happen.”\\n\\n“Good! now thou’rt wise and reasonable. \\xa0And thou’lt restore the pig?”\\n\\n“I will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it\\nand an archangel fetch it. \\xa0Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.\\n\\xa0I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by\\nforce. \\xa0It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down myself\\nbetwixt midnight and the morning.”\\n\\n“Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving\\ncharity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer’s\\nbones for his escape.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV. Hendon Hall.\\n\\nAs soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his\\nMajesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and\\nwait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.\\nHalf an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on\\nHendon’s sorry steeds. \\xa0The King was warm and comfortable, now, for\\nhe had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which\\nHendon had bought on London Bridge.\\n\\nHendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that\\nhard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be\\nbad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise\\nwould be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken\\nintellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the\\ntormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages\\ntoward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying\\nthe impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.\\n\\nWhen he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a\\nconsiderable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn.\\n\\xa0The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King’s\\nchair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was\\nready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept\\nathwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.\\n\\nThe next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking\\nover the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily\\nenjoying each other’s narratives. \\xa0Hendon detailed all his wide\\nwanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had\\nled him a fool’s journey all over the forest, and taken him back to\\nthe hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him. \\xa0Then--he\\nsaid--the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back\\nlooking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy\\nhad returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so. \\xa0Hendon\\nhad waited at the hut all day; hope of the King’s return died out, then,\\nand he departed upon the quest again.\\n\\n“And old Sanctum Sanctorum _was_ truly sorry your highness came not\\nback,” said Hendon; “I saw it in his face.”\\n\\n“Marry I will never doubt _that_!” said the King--and then told his own\\nstory; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.\\n\\nDuring the last day of the trip, Hendon’s spirits were soaring. His\\ntongue ran constantly. \\xa0He talked about his old father, and his brother\\nArthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and\\ngenerous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith,\\nand was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and\\nbrotherly things about Hugh. \\xa0He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting\\nat Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an\\noutburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.\\n\\nIt was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road\\nled through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with\\ngentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding\\nundulations of the sea. \\xa0In the afternoon the returning prodigal made\\nconstant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock\\nhe might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home. \\xa0At\\nlast he was successful, and cried out excitedly--\\n\\n“There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You\\nmay see the towers from here; and that wood there--that is my father’s\\npark. Ah, _now_ thou’lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with\\nseventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants! \\xa0A brave\\nlodging for such as we, is it not so? \\xa0Come, let us speed--my impatience\\nwill not brook further delay.”\\n\\nAll possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o’clock before\\nthe village was reached. \\xa0The travellers scampered through it, Hendon’s\\ntongue going all the time.  “Here is the church--covered with the same\\nivy--none gone, none added.”  “Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and\\nyonder is the market-place.”  “Here is the Maypole, and here the\\npump--nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years\\nmake a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know\\nme.” \\xa0So his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then\\nthe travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall\\nhedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a\\nvast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars\\nbore sculptured armorial devices. \\xa0A noble mansion was before them.\\n\\n“Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!” exclaimed Miles.  “Ah, ’tis a great\\nday! \\xa0My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with\\njoy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first\\ntransports of the meeting, and so thou’lt seem but coldly welcomed--but\\nmind it not; ’twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my\\nward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou’lt see them\\ntake thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon’s sake, and make their house\\nand hearts thy home for ever after!”\\n\\nThe next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door,\\nhelped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few\\nsteps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King\\nwith more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a\\nwriting-table in front of a generous fire of logs.\\n\\n“Embrace me, Hugh,” he cried, “and say thou’rt glad I am come again! and\\ncall our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and\\nsee his face, and hear his voice once more!”\\n\\nBut Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent\\na grave stare upon the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of\\noffended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward\\nthought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with\\na real or assumed compassion. \\xa0Presently he said, in a mild voice--\\n\\n“Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered\\nprivations and rude buffetings at the world’s hands; thy looks and dress\\nbetoken it. \\xa0Whom dost thou take me to be?”\\n\\n“Take thee? \\xa0Prithee for whom else than whom thou art? \\xa0I take thee to\\nbe Hugh Hendon,” said Miles, sharply.\\n\\nThe other continued, in the same soft tone--\\n\\n“And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?”\\n\\n“Imagination hath nought to do with it! \\xa0Dost thou pretend thou knowest\\nme not for thy brother Miles Hendon?”\\n\\nAn expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh’s face, and he\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life? \\xa0God be praised\\nif it be so! \\xa0Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these\\ncruel years! \\xa0Ah, it seems too good to be true, it _is_ too good to be\\ntrue--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me! \\xa0Quick--come to\\nthe light--let me scan thee well!”\\n\\nHe seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to\\ndevour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and\\nthat, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him\\nfrom all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with\\ngladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--\\n\\n“Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou’lt find nor limb nor feature\\nthat cannot bide the test. \\xa0Scour and scan me to thy content, my good\\nold Hugh--I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost\\nbrother, is’t not so? \\xa0Ah, ’tis a great day--I _said_ ’twas a great day!\\n\\xa0Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek--lord, I am like to die of very\\njoy!”\\n\\nHe was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand\\nin dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying\\nwith emotion--\\n\\n“Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous\\ndisappointment!”\\n\\nMiles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue,\\nand cried out--\\n\\n“_What_ disappointment? \\xa0Am I not thy brother?”\\n\\nHugh shook his head sadly, and said--\\n\\n“I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the\\nresemblances that are hid from mine. \\xa0Alack, I fear me the letter spoke\\nbut too truly.”\\n\\n“What letter?”\\n\\n“One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago. \\xa0It said my\\nbrother died in battle.”\\n\\n“It was a lie! \\xa0Call thy father--he will know me.”\\n\\n“One may not call the dead.”\\n\\n“Dead?” Miles’s voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.  “My father\\ndead!--oh, this is heavy news. \\xa0Half my new joy is withered now.\\n\\xa0Prithee let me see my brother Arthur--he will know me; he will know me\\nand console me.”\\n\\n“He, also, is dead.”\\n\\n“God be merciful to me, a stricken man! \\xa0Gone,--both gone--the worthy\\ntaken and the worthless spared, in me! \\xa0Ah! I crave your mercy!--do not\\nsay the Lady Edith--”\\n\\n“Is dead? \\xa0No, she lives.”\\n\\n“Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again! \\xa0Speed thee, brother--let\\nher come to me! \\xa0An’ _she_ say I am not myself--but she will not; no,\\nno, _she_ will know me, I were a fool to doubt it. Bring her--bring the\\nold servants; they, too, will know me.”\\n\\n“All are gone but five--Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret.”\\n\\nSo saying, Hugh left the room. \\xa0Miles stood musing a while, then began\\nto walk the floor, muttering--\\n\\n“The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and\\nhonest--‘tis an odd thing.”\\n\\nHe continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had\\nforgotten the King entirely. \\xa0By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and\\nwith a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were\\ncapable of being interpreted ironically--\\n\\n“Mind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose\\nidentity is denied, and whose claims are derided. \\xa0Thou hast company.”\\n\\n“Ah, my King,” cried Hendon, colouring slightly, “do not thou condemn\\nme--wait, and thou shalt see. \\xa0I am no impostor--she will say it; you\\nshall hear it from the sweetest lips in England. \\xa0I an impostor? \\xa0Why, I\\nknow this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things\\nthat are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery. \\xa0Here was I born\\nand bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and\\nshould none else believe, I pray thee do not _thou_ doubt me--I could\\nnot bear it.”\\n\\n“I do not doubt thee,” said the King, with a childlike simplicity and\\nfaith.\\n\\n“I thank thee out of my heart!” exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which\\nshowed that he was touched. \\xa0The King added, with the same gentle\\nsimplicity--\\n\\n“Dost thou doubt _me_?”\\n\\nA guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door\\nopened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of\\nreplying.\\n\\nA beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came\\nseveral liveried servants. \\xa0The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed\\nand her eyes fixed upon the floor. \\xa0The face was unspeakably sad. \\xa0Miles\\nHendon sprang forward, crying out--\\n\\n“Oh, my Edith, my darling--”\\n\\nBut Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady--\\n\\n“Look upon him. \\xa0Do you know him?”\\n\\nAt the sound of Miles’s voice the woman had started slightly, and her\\ncheeks had flushed; she was trembling now. \\xa0She stood still, during an\\nimpressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and\\nlooked into Hendon’s eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood\\nsank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey\\npallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, “I know\\nhim not!” and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of\\nthe room.\\n\\nMiles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.\\nAfter a pause, his brother said to the servants--\\n\\n“You have observed him. \\xa0Do you know him?”\\n\\nThey shook their heads; then the master said--\\n\\n“The servants know you not, sir. \\xa0I fear there is some mistake. You have\\nseen that my wife knew you not.”\\n\\n“Thy _wife_!” \\xa0In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron\\ngrip about his throat.  “Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!\\n\\xa0Thou’st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods\\nare its fruit. \\xa0There--now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable\\nsoldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!”\\n\\nHugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and\\ncommanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger. \\xa0They\\nhesitated, and one of them said--\\n\\n“He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless.”\\n\\n“Armed! \\xa0What of it, and ye so many? \\xa0Upon him, I say!”\\n\\nBut Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added--\\n\\n“Ye know me of old--I have not changed; come on, an’ it like you.”\\n\\nThis reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.\\n\\n“Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors,\\nwhilst I send one to fetch the watch!” said Hugh. \\xa0He turned at the\\nthreshold, and said to Miles, “You’ll find it to your advantage to\\noffend not with useless endeavours at escape.”\\n\\n“Escape? \\xa0Spare thyself discomfort, an’ that is all that troubles thee.\\nFor Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings. \\xa0He\\nwill remain--doubt it not.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI. Disowned.\\n\\nThe King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said--\\n\\n“‘Tis strange--most strange. \\xa0I cannot account for it.”\\n\\n“No, it is not strange, my liege. \\xa0I know him, and this conduct is but\\nnatural. \\xa0He was a rascal from his birth.”\\n\\n“Oh, I spake not of _him_, Sir Miles.”\\n\\n“Not of him? \\xa0Then of what? \\xa0What is it that is strange?”\\n\\n“That the King is not missed.”\\n\\n“How? \\xa0Which? \\xa0I doubt I do not understand.”\\n\\n“Indeed? \\xa0Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land\\nis not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and\\nmaking search for me? \\xa0Is it no matter for commotion and distress that\\nthe Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?”\\n\\n“Most true, my King, I had forgot.” \\xa0Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to\\nhimself, “Poor ruined mind--still busy with its pathetic dream.”\\n\\n“But I have a plan that shall right us both--I will write a paper, in\\nthree tongues--Latin, Greek and English--and thou shalt haste away with\\nit to London in the morning. \\xa0Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord\\nHertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it. \\xa0Then\\nhe will send for me.”\\n\\n“Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself\\nand make my rights secure to my domains? \\xa0I should be so much the better\\nable then to--”\\n\\nThe King interrupted him imperiously--\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted\\nwith matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a\\nthrone?” \\xa0Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his\\nseverity, “Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee\\nwhole--yes, more than whole. \\xa0I shall remember, and requite.”\\n\\nSo saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work. \\xa0Hendon\\ncontemplated him lovingly a while, then said to himself--\\n\\n“An’ it were dark, I should think it _was_ a king that spoke; there’s\\nno denying it, when the humour’s upon on him he doth thunder and lighten\\nlike your true King; now where got he that trick? \\xa0See him scribble and\\nscratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to\\nbe Latin and Greek--and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device\\nfor diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post\\naway to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me.”\\n\\nThe next moment Sir Miles’s thoughts had gone back to the recent\\nepisode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently\\nhanded him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and\\npocketed it without being conscious of the act. “How marvellous strange\\nshe acted,” he muttered.  “I think she knew me--and I think she did\\n_not_ know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I\\ncannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the\\ntwo, or even persuade one to outweigh the other. \\xa0The matter standeth\\nsimply thus: she _must_ have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how\\ncould it be otherwise? \\xa0Yet she __said_ _she knew me not, and that is\\nproof perfect, for she cannot lie. \\xa0But stop--I think I begin to see.\\nPeradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to\\nlie. \\xa0That is the solution. \\xa0The riddle is unriddled. \\xa0She seemed dead\\nwith fear--yes, she was under his compulsion. \\xa0I will seek her; I will\\nfind her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind. \\xa0She will\\nremember the old times when we were little playfellows together, and\\nthis will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will\\nconfess me. \\xa0There is no treacherous blood in her--no, she was always\\nhonest and true. \\xa0She has loved me, in those old days--this is my\\nsecurity; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray.”\\n\\nHe stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the\\nLady Edith entered. \\xa0She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step,\\nand her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity. Her face was as\\nsad as before.\\n\\nMiles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she\\nchecked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he\\nwas. \\xa0She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise. Thus simply did\\nshe take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him\\ninto a stranger and a guest. \\xa0The surprise of it, the bewildering\\nunexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he\\n_was_ the person he was pretending to be, after all. \\xa0The Lady Edith\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Sir, I have come to warn you. \\xa0The mad cannot be persuaded out of\\ntheir delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid\\nperils. \\xa0I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to\\nyou, and therefore is not criminal--but do not tarry here with it; for\\nhere it is dangerous.” \\xa0She looked steadily into Miles’s face a moment,\\nthen added, impressively, “It is the more dangerous for that you _are_\\nmuch like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived.”\\n\\n“Heavens, madam, but I _am_ he!”\\n\\n“I truly think you think it, sir. \\xa0I question not your honesty in that;\\nI but warn you, that is all. \\xa0My husband is master in this region; his\\npower hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.\\nIf you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might\\nbid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know\\nhim well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a\\nmad impostor, and straightway all will echo him.” \\xa0She bent upon Miles\\nthat same steady look once more, and added:  “If you _were_ Miles\\nHendon, and he knew it and all the region knew it--consider what I\\nam saying, weigh it well--you would stand in the same peril, your\\npunishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce you,\\nand none would be bold enough to give you countenance.”\\n\\n“Most truly I believe it,” said Miles, bitterly.  “The power that\\ncan command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be\\nobeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are\\non the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned.”\\n\\nA faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady’s cheek, and she dropped\\nher eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she\\nproceeded--\\n\\n“I have warned you--I must still warn you--to go hence. \\xa0This man will\\ndestroy you, else. \\xa0He is a tyrant who knows no pity. \\xa0I, who am\\nhis fettered slave, know this. \\xa0Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear\\nguardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest: \\xa0better that\\nyou were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this\\nmiscreant. \\xa0Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions;\\nyou have assaulted him in his own house: \\xa0you are ruined if you stay.\\n\\xa0Go--do not hesitate. If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you,\\nand bribe the servants to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and\\nescape while you may.”\\n\\nMiles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before\\nher.\\n\\n“Grant me one thing,” he said.  “Let your eyes rest upon mine, so that I\\nmay see if they be steady. \\xa0There--now answer me. \\xa0Am I Miles Hendon?”\\n\\n“No. \\xa0I know you not.”\\n\\n“Swear it!”\\n\\nThe answer was low, but distinct--\\n\\n“I swear.”\\n\\n“Oh, this passes belief!”\\n\\n“Fly! \\xa0Why will you waste the precious time? \\xa0Fly, and save yourself.”\\n\\nAt that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle\\nbegan; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away. The King was\\ntaken also, and both were bound and led to prison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII. In Prison.\\n\\nThe cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large\\nroom where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.\\nThey had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered\\nprisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,--an obscene and noisy\\ngang. \\xa0The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put\\nupon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn. \\xa0He was pretty\\nthoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting\\nto find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the\\ncold shoulder and a jail. \\xa0The promise and the fulfilment differed so\\nwidely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it\\nwas most tragic or most grotesque. \\xa0He felt much as a man might who had\\ndanced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning.\\n\\nBut gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into\\nsome sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith. \\xa0He\\nturned her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not\\nmake anything satisfactory out of it. \\xa0Did she know him--or didn’t she\\nknow him? \\xa0It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but\\nhe ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had\\nrepudiated him for interested reasons. \\xa0He wanted to load her name with\\ncurses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found\\nhe could not bring his tongue to profane it.\\n\\nWrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon\\nand the King passed a troubled night. \\xa0For a bribe the jailer had\\nfurnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs,\\nfighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence. \\xa0At last,\\na while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by\\nbeating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could\\ncome to the rescue. \\xa0The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound\\nclubbing about the head and shoulders--then the carousing ceased;\\nand after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the\\nannoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.\\n\\nDuring the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous\\nsameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less\\ndistinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the ‘impostor’ and repudiate\\nand insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with\\nsymmetrical regularity. \\xa0However, there was a change of incident at\\nlast. The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him--\\n\\n“The villain is in this room--cast thy old eyes about and see if thou\\ncanst say which is he.”\\n\\nHendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first\\ntime since he had been in the jail. \\xa0He said to himself, “This is Blake\\nAndrews, a servant all his life in my father’s family--a good honest\\nsoul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly. \\xa0But none are\\ntrue now; all are liars. \\xa0This man will know me--and will deny me, too,\\nlike the rest.”\\n\\nThe old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and\\nfinally said--\\n\\n“I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o’ the streets. \\xa0Which is he?”\\n\\nThe jailer laughed.\\n\\n“Here,” he said; “scan this big animal, and grant me an opinion.”\\n\\nThe old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then\\nshook his head and said--\\n\\n“Marry, _this_ is no Hendon--nor ever was!”\\n\\n“Right! \\xa0Thy old eyes are sound yet. \\xa0An’ I were Sir Hugh, I would take\\nthe shabby carle and--”\\n\\nThe jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary\\nhalter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat\\nsuggestive of suffocation. \\xa0The old man said, vindictively--\\n\\n“Let him bless God an’ he fare no worse. \\xa0An’ _I_ had the handling o’\\nthe villain he should roast, or I am no true man!”\\n\\nThe jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said--\\n\\n“Give him a piece of thy mind, old man--they all do it. \\xa0Thou’lt find it\\ngood diversion.”\\n\\nThen he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared. \\xa0The old man\\ndropped upon his knees and whispered--\\n\\n“God be thanked, thou’rt come again, my master! \\xa0I believed thou wert\\ndead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive! \\xa0I knew thee the\\nmoment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance\\nand seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o’ the\\nstreets. I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go\\nforth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it.”\\n\\n“No,” said Hendon; “thou shalt not. \\xa0It would ruin thee, and yet help\\nbut little in my cause. \\xa0But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back\\nsomewhat of my lost faith in my kind.”\\n\\nThe old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for\\nhe dropped in several times a day to ‘abuse’ the former, and always\\nsmuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he\\nalso furnished the current news. \\xa0Hendon reserved the dainties for the\\nKing; without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was\\nnot able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer.\\n\\xa0Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to\\navoid suspicion; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information\\neach time--information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon’s benefit,\\nand interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for\\nthe benefit of other hearers.\\n\\nSo, little by little, the story of the family came out. \\xa0Arthur had\\nbeen dead six years. \\xa0This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon,\\nimpaired the father’s health; he believed he was going to die, and he\\nwished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but\\nEdith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles’s return; then the letter\\ncame which brought the news of Miles’s death; the shock prostrated Sir\\nRichard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted\\nupon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month’s respite,\\nthen another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by\\nthe death-bed of Sir Richard. \\xa0It had not proved a happy one. \\xa0It was\\nwhispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride\\nfound among her husband’s papers several rough and incomplete drafts of\\nthe fatal letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage--and\\nSir Richard’s death, too--by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the\\nLady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the\\nfather’s death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become\\na pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his\\ndomains for bread.\\n\\nThere was a bit of Andrew’s gossip which the King listened to with a\\nlively interest--\\n\\n“There is rumour that the King is mad. \\xa0But in charity forbear to say\\n_I_ mentioned it, for ’tis death to speak of it, they say.”\\n\\nHis Majesty glared at the old man and said--\\n\\n“The King is _not_ mad, good man--and thou’lt find it to thy advantage\\nto busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this\\nseditious prattle.”\\n\\n“What doth the lad mean?” said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault\\nfrom such an unexpected quarter. \\xa0Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not\\npursue his question, but went on with his budget--\\n\\n“The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two--the 16th of\\nthe month--and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th.”\\n\\n“Methinks they must needs find him first,” muttered his Majesty; then\\nadded, confidently, “but they will look to that--and so also shall I.”\\n\\n“In the name of--”\\n\\nBut the old man got no further--a warning sign from Hendon checked his\\nremark. \\xa0He resumed the thread of his gossip--\\n\\n“Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation--and with grand hopes. \\xa0He confidently\\nlooketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord\\nProtector.”\\n\\n“What Lord Protector?” asked his Majesty.\\n\\n“His Grace the Duke of Somerset.”\\n\\n“What Duke of Somerset?”\\n\\n“Marry, there is but one--Seymour, Earl of Hertford.”\\n\\nThe King asked sharply--\\n\\n“Since when is _he_ a duke, and Lord Protector?”\\n\\n“Since the last day of January.”\\n\\n“And prithee who made him so?”\\n\\n“Himself and the Great Council--with help of the King.”\\n\\nHis Majesty started violently.  “The _King_!” he cried.  “_What_ king,\\ngood sir?”\\n\\n“What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?) \\xa0Sith we have\\nbut one, ’tis not difficult to answer--his most sacred Majesty King\\nEdward the Sixth--whom God preserve! \\xa0Yea, and a dear and gracious\\nlittle urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no--and they say he\\nmendeth daily--his praises are on all men’s lips; and all bless him,\\nlikewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in\\nEngland; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk’s\\nlife, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that\\nharry and oppress the people.”\\n\\nThis news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into\\nso deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man’s\\ngossip. He wondered if the ‘little urchin’ was the beggar-boy whom\\nhe left dressed in his own garments in the palace. \\xa0It did not seem\\npossible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would\\nbetray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be\\ndriven out, and search made for the true prince. \\xa0Could it be that the\\nCourt had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place? \\xa0No, for his\\nuncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would\\ncrush such a movement, of course. \\xa0The boy’s musings profited him\\nnothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he\\nbecame, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. \\xa0His\\nimpatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost\\nunendurable.\\n\\nHendon’s arts all failed with the King--he could not be comforted; but a\\ncouple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their\\ngentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience.\\n\\xa0He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in\\nthe sweet and soothing influence of their presence. \\xa0He asked them why\\nthey were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled,\\nand inquired--\\n\\n“Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? \\xa0Now I grieve, for I\\nshall lose ye--they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.”\\n\\nThey did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He\\nsaid, eagerly--\\n\\n“You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me--there will be no other\\npunishment? \\xa0Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.”\\n\\nThey tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he\\npursued it--\\n\\n“Will they scourge thee? \\xa0No, no, they would not be so cruel! \\xa0Say they\\nwould not. \\xa0Come, they _will_ not, will they?”\\n\\nThe women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an\\nanswer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion--\\n\\n“Oh, thou’lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!--God will help us to\\nbear our--”\\n\\n“It is a confession!” the King broke in.  “Then they _will_ scourge\\nthee, the stony-hearted wretches! \\xa0But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot\\nbear it. \\xa0Keep up thy courage--I shall come to my own in time to save\\nthee from this bitter thing, and I will do it!”\\n\\nWhen the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.\\n\\n“They are saved!” he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, “but woe\\nis me!--for they were my comforters.”\\n\\nEach of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token\\nof remembrance. \\xa0He said he would keep these things always; and that\\nsoon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them\\nunder his protection.\\n\\nJust then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that\\nthe prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. \\xa0The King was overjoyed--it\\nwould be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air\\nonce more. \\xa0He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but\\nhis turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered\\nto follow the other prisoners with Hendon.\\n\\nThe court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky. \\xa0The\\nprisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were\\nplaced in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope\\nwas stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their\\nofficers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which\\nhad fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added\\nto the general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind\\nshivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.\\n\\nIn the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts. \\xa0A glance\\nshowed the King that these were his good friends. \\xa0He shuddered, and\\nsaid to himself, “Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. \\xa0To\\nthink that such as these should know the lash!--in England! \\xa0Ay, there’s\\nthe shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England! \\xa0They will be\\nscourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must\\nlook on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that\\nI, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect\\nthem. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a\\nday coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.\\n\\xa0For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then.”\\n\\nA great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in. \\xa0They\\nflocked around the two women, and hid them from the King’s view. A\\nclergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden.\\n\\xa0The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being\\nasked and answered, but he could not make out what was said. \\xa0Next there\\nwas a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of\\nofficials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side\\nof the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon\\nthe people.\\n\\nNow, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a\\nspectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. \\xa0Faggots had been piled\\nabout the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!\\n\\nThe women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;\\nthe yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling\\nfaggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the\\nclergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls\\ncame flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw\\nthemselves upon the women at the stake. \\xa0Instantly they were torn away\\nby the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other\\nbroke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could\\nbe stopped she had flung her arms about her mother’s neck again. \\xa0She\\nwas torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. \\xa0Two or three men\\nheld her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and\\nthrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and\\nsaying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed\\nto die with her mother. \\xa0Both the girls screamed continually, and fought\\nfor freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of\\nheart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the\\nfrantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face\\nagainst the wall, and looked no more. \\xa0He said, “That which I have seen,\\nin that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will\\nabide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the\\nnights, till I die. \\xa0Would God I had been blind!”\\n\\nHendon was watching the King. \\xa0He said to himself, with satisfaction,\\n“His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. \\xa0If he had\\nfollowed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he\\nwas King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. \\xa0Soon\\nhis delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be\\nwhole again. \\xa0God speed the day!”\\n\\nThat same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,\\nwho were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,\\nto undergo punishment for crimes committed. \\xa0The King conversed with\\nthese--he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself\\nfor the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity\\noffered--and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. \\xa0One of them was\\na poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a\\nweaver--she was to be hanged for it. \\xa0Another was a man who had been\\naccused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had\\nimagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free\\nbefore he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King’s park; this was\\nproved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows. \\xa0There was\\na tradesman’s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King;\\nthis youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its\\nowner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;\\nbut the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.\\n\\nThe King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break\\njail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne\\nand hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and\\nsave their lives.  “Poor child,” sighed Hendon, “these woeful tales\\nhave brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he\\nwould have been well in a little time.”\\n\\nAmong these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a\\ndauntless mien. \\xa0Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the\\nLord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for\\nit by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the\\nbar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to\\nimprisonment for life. \\xa0Lately he had repeated his offence; and in\\nconsequence was now under sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_,\\npay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in\\nprison for life.\\n\\n“These be honourable scars,” he said, and turned back his grey hair and\\nshowed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.\\n\\nThe King’s eye burned with passion. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“None believe in me--neither wilt thou. \\xa0But no matter--within the\\ncompass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have\\ndishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the\\nstatute books. \\xa0The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to\\ntheir own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.” {1}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII. The sacrifice.\\n\\nMeantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and\\ninaction. \\xa0But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and\\nhe thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment\\nshould not be a part of it. \\xa0But he was mistaken about that. \\xa0He was in\\na fine fury when he found himself described as a ‘sturdy vagabond’ and\\nsentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character\\nand for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. \\xa0His pretensions as to\\nbrothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon\\nhonours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not\\neven worth examination.\\n\\nHe raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he\\nwas snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff,\\nbesides, for his irreverent conduct.\\n\\nThe King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so\\nhe was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and\\nservant. \\xa0The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for\\nbeing in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a\\nwarning, in consideration of his youth. \\xa0When the crowd at last halted,\\nhe flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting\\na place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and\\ndelay, succeeded. \\xa0There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks,\\nthe sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King\\nof England! \\xa0Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not\\nrealised the half that it meant. \\xa0His anger began to rise as the sense\\nof this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped\\nto summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air\\nand crush itself against Hendon’s cheek, and heard the crowd roar\\nits enjoyment of the episode. \\xa0He sprang across the open circle and\\nconfronted the officer in charge, crying--\\n\\n“For shame! \\xa0This is my servant--set him free! \\xa0I am the--”\\n\\n“Oh, peace!” exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, “thou’lt destroy thyself.\\nMind him not, officer, he is mad.”\\n\\n“Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I\\nhave small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that\\nI am well inclined.” \\xa0He turned to a subordinate and said, “Give the\\nlittle fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners.”\\n\\n“Half a dozen will better serve his turn,” suggested Sir Hugh, who had\\nridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings.\\n\\nThe King was seized. \\xa0He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he\\nwith the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be\\ninflicted upon his sacred person. \\xa0History was already defiled with\\nthe record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an\\nintolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful\\npage. \\xa0He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either\\ntake this punishment or beg for its remission. \\xa0Hard conditions; he\\nwould take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg.\\n\\nBut meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty.  “Let the child\\ngo,” said he; “ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he\\nis? \\xa0Let him go--I will take his lashes.”\\n\\n“Marry, a good thought--and thanks for it,” said Sir Hugh, his face\\nlighting with a sardonic satisfaction.  “Let the little beggar go, and\\ngive this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on.”\\n The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh\\nsilenced him with the potent remark, “Yes, speak up, do, and free thy\\nmind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six\\nstrokes the more.”\\n\\nHendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst\\nthe lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and\\nallowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked. “Ah, brave good\\nheart,” he said to himself, “this loyal deed shall never perish out of\\nmy memory. \\xa0I will not forget it--and neither shall _they_!” he added,\\nwith passion. \\xa0Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon’s magnanimous\\nconduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and\\nso also did his gratefulness for it. \\xa0Presently he said to himself, “Who\\nsaves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for\\nme--performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less\\nthan nothing!--when ’tis weighed against the act of him who saves his\\nprince from _shame_!”\\n\\nHendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with\\nsoldierly fortitude. \\xa0This, together with his redeeming the boy by\\ntaking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn\\nand degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings\\ndied away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows.\\n\\xa0The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once\\nmore in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour\\nwhich had prevailed there so little a while before. \\xa0The King came\\nsoftly to Hendon’s side, and whispered in his ear--\\n\\n“Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher\\nthan kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility\\nto men.” \\xa0He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon’s\\nbleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, “Edward of England\\ndubs thee Earl!”\\n\\nHendon was touched. \\xa0The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time\\nthe grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his\\ngravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward\\nmirth from showing outside. \\xa0To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory,\\nfrom the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of\\nan Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the\\ngrotesque. \\xa0He said to himself, “Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!\\n\\xa0The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a\\nspectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing! \\xa0An’ this go on, I\\nshall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and\\nmake-believe honours. \\xa0But I shall value them, all valueless as\\nthey are, for the love that doth bestow them. Better these poor mock\\ndignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right\\nspirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested\\npower.”\\n\\nThe dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away,\\nthe living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed\\ntogether again. \\xa0And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture\\na remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no\\nmatter--the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself. \\xa0A\\nlate comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who\\ndelivered a sneer at the ‘impostor,’ and was in the act of following it\\nwith a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any\\nwords, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX. To London.\\n\\nWhen Hendon’s term of service in the stocks was finished, he was\\nreleased and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His sword\\nwas restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He mounted\\nand rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet\\nrespectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when they were\\ngone.\\n\\nHendon was soon absorbed in thought. \\xa0There were questions of high\\nimport to be answered. \\xa0What should he do? \\xa0Whither should he go?\\nPowerful help must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his\\ninheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor\\nbesides. \\xa0Where could he hope to find this powerful help? \\xa0Where,\\nindeed! \\xa0It was a knotty question. By-and-by a thought occurred to him\\nwhich pointed to a possibility--the slenderest of slender possibilities,\\ncertainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that\\npromised anything at all. \\xa0He remembered what old Andrews had said about\\nthe young King’s goodness and his generous championship of the wronged\\nand unfortunate. \\xa0Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for\\njustice? \\xa0Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the\\naugust presence of a monarch? Never mind--let that matter take care of\\nitself; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should\\ncome to it. \\xa0He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and\\nexpedients: \\xa0no doubt he would be able to find a way. \\xa0Yes, he would\\nstrike for the capital. Maybe his father’s old friend Sir Humphrey\\nMarlow would help him--‘good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the\\nlate King’s kitchen, or stables, or something’--Miles could not remember\\njust what or which. \\xa0Now that he had something to turn his energies to,\\na distinctly defined object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and\\ndepression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away,\\nand he raised his head and looked about him. \\xa0He was surprised to see\\nhow far he had come; the village was away behind him. \\xa0The King was\\njogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he, too, was deep\\nin plans and thinkings. \\xa0A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon’s new-born\\ncheerfulness: \\xa0would the boy be willing to go again to a city where,\\nduring all his brief life, he had never known anything but ill-usage and\\npinching want? \\xa0But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided;\\nso Hendon reined up, and called out--\\n\\n“I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. \\xa0Thy commands, my\\nliege!”\\n\\n“To London!”\\n\\nHendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer--but astounded\\nat it too.\\n\\nThe whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it\\nended with one. \\xa0About ten o’clock on the night of the 19th of February\\nthey stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling\\njam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out\\nstrongly in the glare from manifold torches--and at that instant the\\ndecaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between\\nthem, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the\\nhurrying confusion of feet. So evanescent and unstable are men’s works\\nin this world!--the late good King is but three weeks dead and three\\ndays in his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains\\nto select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling. \\xa0A\\ncitizen stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of\\nsomebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person\\nthat came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person’s\\nfriend. \\xa0It was the right ripe time for a free fight, for the\\nfestivities of the morrow--Coronation Day--were already beginning;\\neverybody was full of strong drink and patriotism; within five minutes\\nthe free fight was occupying a good deal of ground; within ten or twelve\\nit covered an acre of so, and was become a riot. \\xa0By this time Hendon\\nand the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the\\nrush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity. \\xa0And so we leave\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX. Tom’s progress.\\n\\nWhilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly\\nfed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves\\nand murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by\\nall impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different\\nexperience.\\n\\nWhen we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side\\nfor him. \\xa0This bright side went on brightening more and more every\\nday: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and\\ndelightfulness. \\xa0He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;\\nhis embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident\\nbearing. \\xa0He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.\\n\\nHe ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence\\nwhen he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with\\nthem, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances.\\n\\xa0It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand\\nat parting.\\n\\nHe came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed\\nwith intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. \\xa0It came to be a\\nproud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession\\nof officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he\\ndoubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. \\xa0He\\nliked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the\\ndistant voices responding, “Way for the King!”\\n\\nHe even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and\\nseeming to be something more than the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece. He\\nliked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen\\nto the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who\\ncalled him brother. \\xa0O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!\\n\\nHe enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: \\xa0he found his four\\nhundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. \\xa0The\\nadulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears. \\xa0He\\nremained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all\\nthat were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: \\xa0yet\\nupon occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a\\nduke, and give him a look that would make him tremble. \\xa0Once, when his\\nroyal ‘sister,’ the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with\\nhim against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who\\nwould otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that\\ntheir august late father’s prisons had sometimes contained as high as\\nsixty thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign\\nhe had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death\\nby the executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation,\\nand commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the\\nstone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.\\n\\nDid Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince\\nwho had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to\\navenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first\\nroyal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts\\nabout the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and\\nhappy restoration to his native rights and splendours. \\xa0But as time\\nwore on, and the prince did not come, Tom’s mind became more and more\\noccupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and\\nlittle the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and\\nfinally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an\\nunwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.\\n\\nTom’s poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.\\nAt first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but\\nlater, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and\\nbetraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty\\nplace, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,\\nmade him shudder. \\xa0At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost\\nwholly. \\xa0And he was content, even glad: \\xa0for, whenever their mournful\\nand accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more\\ndespicable than the worms that crawl.\\n\\nAt midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in\\nhis rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded\\nby the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed\\nfor his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same hour, Edward,\\nthe true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with\\ntravel, and clothed in rags and shreds--his share of the results of the\\nriot--was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep\\ninterest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of\\nWestminster Abbey, busy as ants: \\xa0they were making the last preparation\\nfor the royal coronation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI. The Recognition procession.\\n\\nWhen Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a\\nthunderous murmur: \\xa0all the distances were charged with it. \\xa0It was\\nmusic to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its\\nstrength to give loyal welcome to the great day.\\n\\nPresently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful\\nfloating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the ‘recognition\\nprocession’ through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound\\nthither.\\n\\nWhen he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed\\nsuddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a\\nred tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion\\nfollowed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the\\nground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were\\nrepeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few\\nmoments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all\\nbut the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with\\nits banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak\\nprojects above a cloud-rack.\\n\\nTom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich\\ntrappings almost reached to the ground; his ‘uncle,’ the Lord Protector\\nSomerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King’s Guard\\nformed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour;\\nafter the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of\\nresplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord\\nmayor and the aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their\\ngold chains across their breasts; and after these the officers and\\nmembers of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the\\nshowy banners of the several corporations. \\xa0Also in the procession, as a\\nspecial guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable\\nArtillery Company--an organisation already three hundred years old\\nat that time, and the only military body in England possessing the\\nprivilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself\\nindependent of the commands of Parliament. \\xa0It was a brilliant\\nspectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as it\\ntook its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens. The\\nchronicler says, ‘The King, as he entered the city, was received by the\\npeople with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and all signs\\nwhich argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign; and the\\nKing, by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, and\\nmost tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself\\nno less thankful to receive the people’s goodwill than they to offer it.\\n\\xa0To all that wished him well, he gave thanks. \\xa0To such as bade “God save\\nhis Grace,” he said in return, “God save you all!” and added that “he\\nthanked them with all his heart.” Wonderfully transported were the\\npeople with the loving answers and gestures of their King.’\\n\\nIn Fenchurch Street a ‘fair child, in costly apparel,’ stood on a stage\\nto welcome his Majesty to the city. \\xa0The last verse of his greeting was\\nin these words--\\n\\n‘Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think; Welcome, again, as much\\nas tongue can tell,--Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will\\nnot shrink: God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.’\\n\\nThe people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what\\nthe child had said. \\xa0Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of\\neager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that\\nthe one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a\\nnation’s idol. \\xa0Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple\\nof his ragged Offal Court comrades--one of them the lord high admiral in\\nhis late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the\\nsame pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever. \\xa0Oh,\\nif they could only recognise him now! \\xa0What unspeakable glory it would\\nbe, if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king\\nof the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious\\ndukes and princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his\\nfeet! \\xa0But he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such\\na recognition might cost more than it would come to: \\xa0so he turned away\\nhis head, and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and\\nglad adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them\\nupon.\\n\\nEvery now and then rose the cry, “A largess! a largess!” and Tom\\nresponded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the\\nmultitude to scramble for.\\n\\nThe chronicler says, ‘At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the\\nsign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which\\nwas a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.\\nThis was an historical pageant, representing the King’s immediate\\nprogenitors. \\xa0There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense\\nwhite rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her\\nside was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the\\nsame manner: \\xa0the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the\\nwedding-ring ostentatiously displayed. \\xa0From the red and white roses\\nproceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry\\nVIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new\\nKing’s mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side. \\xa0One branch sprang\\nfrom this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of\\nEdward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant\\nwas framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.’\\n\\nThis quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people,\\nthat their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child\\nwhose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes. \\xa0But\\nTom Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him\\nthan any poetry, no matter what its quality might be. \\xa0Whithersoever Tom\\nturned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his\\neffigy’s likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new\\nwhirlwinds of applause burst forth.\\n\\nThe great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after\\nanother, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical\\ntableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or\\nmerit, of the little King’s.  ‘Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from\\nevery penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest\\ncarpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets--specimens\\nof the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this\\nthoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even\\nsurpassed.’\\n\\n“And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me--me!”\\n murmured Tom Canty.\\n\\nThe mock King’s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were\\nflashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. \\xa0At this point,\\njust as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught\\nsight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of\\nthe second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. \\xa0A\\nsickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his\\nmother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes--that old\\ninvoluntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by\\nhabit. \\xa0In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and\\npast the guards, and was at his side. \\xa0She embraced his leg, she covered\\nit with kisses, she cried, “O my child, my darling!” lifting toward him\\na face that was transfigured with joy and love. \\xa0The same instant an\\nofficer of the King’s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent\\nher reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his\\nstrong arm. \\xa0The words “I do not know you, woman!” were falling from Tom\\nCanty’s lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the\\nheart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of\\nhim, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so\\nwounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed\\nhis pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty. \\xa0His grandeurs were\\nstricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.\\n\\nThe procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting\\nsplendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty\\nthey were as if they had not been. \\xa0He neither saw nor heard. \\xa0Royalty\\nhad lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach.\\n\\xa0Remorse was eating his heart out. \\xa0He said, “Would God I were free of\\nmy captivity!”\\n\\nHe had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days\\nof his compulsory greatness.\\n\\nThe shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable\\nserpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the\\nhuzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes,\\nseeing only his mother’s face and that wounded look in it.\\n\\n“Largess, largess!” \\xa0The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.\\n\\n“Long live Edward of England!” \\xa0It seemed as if the earth shook with the\\nexplosion; but there was no response from the King. \\xa0He heard it only as\\none hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a\\ngreat distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still\\nnearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience--a voice which\\nkept repeating those shameful words, “I do not know you, woman!”\\n\\nThe words smote upon the King’s soul as the strokes of a funeral bell\\nsmite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret\\ntreacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone.\\n\\nNew glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels,\\nsprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released;\\nnew raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes: \\xa0but the\\nKing gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his\\ncomfortless breast was all the sound he heard.\\n\\nBy-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little,\\nand became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety: \\xa0an\\nabatement in the volume of the applause was observable too. \\xa0The Lord\\nProtector was quick to notice these things: \\xa0he was as quick to detect\\nthe cause. \\xa0He spurred to the King’s side, bent low in his saddle,\\nuncovered, and said--\\n\\n“My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. \\xa0The people observe thy\\ndowncast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen. \\xa0Be\\nadvised: \\xa0unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding\\nvapours, and disperse them. \\xa0Lift up thy face, and smile upon the\\npeople.”\\n\\nSo saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then\\nretired to his place. \\xa0The mock King did mechanically as he had been\\nbidden. \\xa0His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough\\nor sharp enough to detect that. \\xa0The noddings of his plumed head as he\\nsaluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess\\nwhich he delivered from his hand was royally liberal: \\xa0so the people’s\\nanxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a\\nvolume as before.\\n\\nStill once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was\\nobliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. \\xa0He whispered--\\n\\n“O dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world\\nare upon thee.” \\xa0Then he added with sharp annoyance, “Perdition catch\\nthat crazy pauper! ’twas she that hath disturbed your Highness.”\\n\\nThe gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a\\ndead voice--\\n\\n“She was my mother!”\\n\\n“My God!” groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his\\npost, “the omen was pregnant with prophecy. \\xa0He is gone mad again!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII. Coronation Day.\\n\\nLet us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster\\nAbbey, at four o’clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day.\\n\\xa0We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find\\nthe torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well\\ncontent to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall\\ncome for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their\\nlives--the coronation of a King. \\xa0Yes, London and Westminster have been\\nastir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o’clock, and already\\ncrowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying\\nto find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances\\nreserved for their sort.\\n\\nThe hours drag along tediously enough. \\xa0All stir has ceased for some\\ntime, for every gallery has long ago been packed. \\xa0We may sit, now, and\\nlook and think at our leisure. \\xa0We have glimpses, here and there\\nand yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many\\ngalleries and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other\\nportions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by\\nintervening pillars and architectural projections. \\xa0We have in view\\nthe whole of the great north transept--empty, and waiting for England’s\\nprivileged ones. \\xa0We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with\\nrich stuffs, whereon the throne stands. \\xa0The throne occupies the centre\\nof the platform, and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps.\\nWithin the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock--the stone\\nof Scone--which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned,\\nand so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for\\nEnglish monarchs. \\xa0Both the throne and its footstool are covered with\\ncloth of gold.\\n\\nStillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily.\\nBut at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are\\nextinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All\\nfeatures of the noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy,\\nfor the sun is lightly veiled with clouds.\\n\\nAt seven o’clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on\\nthe stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed\\nlike Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place\\nby an official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him\\ngathers up the lady’s long train, follows after, and, when the lady is\\nseated, arranges the train across her lap for her. \\xa0He then places her\\nfootstool according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where\\nit will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous\\ncoroneting of the nobles shall arrive.\\n\\nBy this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and\\nthe satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating\\nthem and making them comfortable. \\xa0The scene is animated enough now.\\n\\xa0There is stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere. \\xa0After a time,\\nquiet reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their\\nplaces, a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in\\nvariegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds. \\xa0There\\nare all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able\\nto go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the\\ncrowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten\\nage; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious\\nyoung matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes\\nand fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets\\nawkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to\\nthem, and their excitement will be a sore hindrance. Still, this may\\nnot happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a\\nspecial view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its\\nplace when the signal comes.\\n\\nWe have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with\\ndiamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle--but now we\\nare about to be astonished in earnest. \\xa0About nine, the clouds suddenly\\nbreak away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and\\ndrifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches\\nflames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle\\nto our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by\\nthe surprise and the beauty of the spectacle! \\xa0Presently a special envoy\\nfrom some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body\\nof foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our\\nbreath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is\\nso overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his\\nslightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.\\n\\nLet us change the tense for convenience. \\xa0The time drifted along--one\\nhour--two hours--two hours and a half; then the deep booming of\\nartillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at\\nlast; so the waiting multitude rejoiced. \\xa0All knew that a further delay\\nmust follow, for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn\\nceremony; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling\\nof the peers of the realm in their stately robes. \\xa0These were conducted\\nceremoniously to their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently\\nat hand; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with\\ninterest, for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes,\\nearls, and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred\\nyears. \\xa0When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries\\nand all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and\\nto remember.\\n\\nNow the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their\\nattendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places;\\nthese were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and\\nthese again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.\\n\\nThere was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music\\nburst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold,\\nappeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform. \\xa0The entire multitude\\nrose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued.\\n\\nThen a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and\\nthus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne.\\n\\xa0The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the\\naudience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom\\nCanty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe\\nand despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful\\nheart.\\n\\nAt last the final act was at hand. \\xa0The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted\\nup the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the\\ntrembling mock-King’s head. \\xa0In the same instant a rainbow-radiance\\nflashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every\\nindividual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised\\nit over his or her head--and paused in that attitude.\\n\\nA deep hush pervaded the Abbey. \\xa0At this impressive moment, a startling\\napparition intruded upon the scene--an apparition observed by none in\\nthe absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great\\ncentral aisle. \\xa0It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in\\ncoarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags. \\xa0He raised his hand\\nwith a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect,\\nand delivered this note of warning--\\n\\n“I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head. \\xa0I\\nam the King!”\\n\\nIn an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in\\nthe same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step\\nforward, and cried out in a ringing voice--\\n\\n“Loose him and forbear! \\xa0He _is_ the King!”\\n\\nA sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly\\nrose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and\\nat the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether\\nthey were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming. \\xa0The Lord\\nProtector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and\\nexclaimed in a voice of authority--\\n\\n“Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again--seize the\\nvagabond!”\\n\\nHe would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried\\nout--\\n\\n“On your peril! \\xa0Touch him not, he is the King!”\\n\\nThe hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved,\\nno one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so\\nstrange and surprising an emergency. \\xa0While all minds were struggling to\\nright themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port\\nand confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while\\nthe tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the\\nplatform, and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell\\non his knees before him and said--\\n\\n“Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to\\nthee, and say, ‘Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!’”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector’s eye fell sternly upon the new-comer’s face; but\\nstraightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression\\nof wondering surprise. \\xa0This thing happened also to the other great\\nofficers. \\xa0They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common\\nand unconscious impulse. \\xa0The thought in each mind was the same:  “What\\na strange resemblance!”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he\\nsaid, with grave respectfulness--\\n\\n“By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which--”\\n\\n“I will answer them, my lord.”\\n\\nThe Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the\\nprince, the princesses--the boy answered them correctly and without\\nhesitating. \\xa0He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late\\nKing’s apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales.\\n\\nIt was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable--so all said\\nthat heard it. \\xa0The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty’s hopes to\\nrun high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said--\\n\\n“It is true it is most wonderful--but it is no more than our lord the\\nKing likewise can do.” \\xa0This remark, and this reference to himself as\\nstill the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from\\nunder him.  “These are not _proofs_,” added the Protector.\\n\\nThe tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed--but in the wrong\\ndirection; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne,\\nand sweeping the other out to sea. \\xa0The Lord Protector communed with\\nhimself--shook his head--the thought forced itself upon him, “It is\\nperilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as\\nthis; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.” \\xa0He turned\\nand said--\\n\\n“Sir Thomas, arrest this--No, hold!” \\xa0His face lighted, and he\\nconfronted the ragged candidate with this question--\\n\\n“Where lieth the Great Seal? \\xa0Answer me this truly, and the riddle is\\nunriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales _can_ so answer! On so\\ntrivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!”\\n\\nIt was a lucky thought, a happy thought. \\xa0That it was so considered by\\nthe great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from\\neye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.\\nYes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the\\nvanished Great Seal--this forlorn little impostor had been taught his\\nlesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself\\ncould not answer _that_ question--ah, very good, very good indeed;\\nnow we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in\\nshort order! And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with\\nsatisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy\\nof guilty confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of\\nthe sort happen--how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a\\nconfident and untroubled voice, and say--\\n\\n“There is nought in this riddle that is difficult.” \\xa0Then, without so\\nmuch as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command,\\nwith the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: “My Lord\\nSt. John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace--for none knoweth\\nthe place better than you--and, close down to the floor, in the left\\ncorner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you\\nshall find in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little\\njewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of--no, nor\\nany soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did\\ncontrive it for me. The first thing that falleth under your eye will be\\nthe Great Seal--fetch it hither.”\\n\\nAll the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see\\nthe little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent\\nfear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing\\nair of having known him all his life. \\xa0The peer was almost surprised\\ninto obeying. \\xa0He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly\\nrecovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush.\\n\\xa0Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply--\\n\\n“Why dost thou hesitate? \\xa0Hast not heard the King’s command? \\xa0Go!”\\n\\nThe Lord St. John made a deep obeisance--and it was observed that it was\\na significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered\\nat either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between\\nthe two--and took his leave.\\n\\nNow began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group\\nwhich was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent--a\\nmovement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly,\\nwhereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join\\nthemselves to another--a movement which, little by little, in the\\npresent case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty\\nand clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer.\\n\\xa0Tom Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep\\nsuspense and waiting--during which even the few faint hearts still\\nremaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to\\nglide, one by one, over to the majority. \\xa0So at last Tom Canty, in his\\nroyal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world,\\na conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.\\n\\nNow the Lord St. John was seen returning. \\xa0As he advanced up\\nthe mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of\\nconversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by\\na profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his footfalls\\npulsed with a dull and distant sound. \\xa0Every eye was fastened upon him\\nas he moved along. \\xa0He reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved\\ntoward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance, and said--\\n\\n“Sire, the Seal is not there!”\\n\\nA mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more\\nhaste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from\\nthe presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown. \\xa0In a moment\\nhe stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which\\nwas concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks. \\xa0The Lord\\nProtector called out fiercely--\\n\\n“Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town--the\\npaltry knave is worth no more consideration!”\\n\\nOfficers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them\\noff and said--\\n\\n“Back! \\xa0Whoso touches him perils his life!”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. \\xa0He said to the\\nLord St. John--\\n\\n“Searched you well?--but it boots not to ask that. \\xa0It doth seem passing\\nstrange. \\xa0Little things, trifles, slip out of one’s ken, and one does\\nnot think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the\\nSeal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it\\nagain--a massy golden disk--”\\n\\nTom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted--\\n\\n“Hold, that is enough! \\xa0Was it round?--and thick?--and had it letters\\nand devices graved upon it?--yes? \\xa0Oh, _now_ I know what this Great Seal\\nis that there’s been such worry and pother about. An’ ye had described\\nit to me, ye could have had it three weeks ago. \\xa0Right well I know where\\nit lies; but it was not I that put it there--first.”\\n\\n“Who, then, my liege?” asked the Lord Protector.\\n\\n“He that stands there--the rightful King of England. \\xa0And he shall tell\\nyou himself where it lies--then you will believe he knew it of his own\\nknowledge. \\xa0Bethink thee, my King--spur thy memory--it was the last, the\\nvery _last_ thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from\\nthe palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me.”\\n\\nA silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes\\nwere fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated\\nbrow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless\\nrecollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would\\nseat him upon a throne--unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and\\nall--a pauper and an outcast. \\xa0Moment after moment passed--the moments\\nbuilt themselves into minutes--still the boy struggled silently on, and\\ngave no sign. \\xa0But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and\\nsaid, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice--\\n\\n“I call the scene back--all of it--but the Seal hath no place in it.”\\n \\xa0He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, “My lords and\\ngentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of\\nthis evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being\\npowerless. \\xa0But--”\\n\\n“Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!” cried Tom Canty, in a panic,\\n“wait!--think! \\xa0Do not give up!--the cause is not lost! \\xa0Nor _shall_ be,\\nneither! List to what I say--follow every word--I am going to bring that\\nmorning back again, every hap just as it happened. \\xa0We talked--I told\\nyou of my sisters, Nan and Bet--ah, yes, you remember that; and about\\nmine old grandam--and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court--yes,\\nyou remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall\\nrecall everything. \\xa0You gave me food and drink, and did with princely\\ncourtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame\\nme before them--ah, yes, this also you remember.”\\n\\nAs Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in\\nrecognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in\\npuzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could\\nthis impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come\\nabout? \\xa0Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and\\nso stupefied, before.\\n\\n“For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. \\xa0Then we stood before\\na mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had\\nbeen no change made--yes, you remember that. \\xa0Then you noticed that the\\nsoldier had hurt my hand--look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with\\nit, the fingers are so stiff. \\xa0At this your Highness sprang up, vowing\\nvengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door--you passed a\\ntable--that thing you call the Seal lay on that table--you snatched\\nit up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it--your eye\\ncaught sight of--”\\n\\n“There, ’tis sufficient!--and the good God be thanked!” exclaimed the\\nragged claimant, in a mighty excitement.  “Go, my good St. John--in an\\narm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou’lt find\\nthe Seal!”\\n\\n“Right, my King! right!” cried Tom Canty; “_Now_ the sceptre of England\\nis thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he\\nhad been born dumb! \\xa0Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!”\\n\\nThe whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind\\nwith uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement. \\xa0On the floor\\nand on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst\\nforth, and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was\\ninterested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear,\\nor he was shouting into his neighbour’s ear. \\xa0Time--nobody knew how much\\nof it--swept by unheeded and unnoted. \\xa0At last a sudden hush fell upon\\nthe house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform,\\nand held the Great Seal aloft in his hand. \\xa0Then such a shout went up--\\n\\n“Long live the true King!”\\n\\nFor five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical\\ninstruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and\\nthrough it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England,\\nstood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious\\nplatform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him.\\n\\nThen all rose, and Tom Canty cried out--\\n\\n“Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy\\nservant, his shreds and remnants again.”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector spoke up--\\n\\n“Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower.”\\n\\nBut the new King, the true King, said--\\n\\n“I will not have it so. \\xa0But for him I had not got my crown again--none\\nshall lay a hand upon him to harm him. \\xa0And as for thee, my good uncle,\\nmy Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward\\nthis poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke”--the Protector\\nblushed--“yet he was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title\\nworth now? \\xa0To-morrow you shall sue to me, _through him_, for its\\nconfirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain.”\\n\\nUnder this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from\\nthe front for the moment. \\xa0The King turned to Tom, and said kindly--“My\\npoor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I\\ncould not remember it myself?”\\n\\n“Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days.”\\n\\n“Used it--yet could not explain where it was?”\\n\\n“I did not know it was _that_ they wanted. \\xa0They did not describe it,\\nyour Majesty.”\\n\\n“Then how used you it?”\\n\\nThe red blood began to steal up into Tom’s cheeks, and he dropped his\\neyes and was silent.\\n\\n“Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing,” said the King.  “How used you\\nthe Great Seal of England?”\\n\\nTom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out--\\n\\n“To crack nuts with!”\\n\\nPoor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him\\noff his feet. \\xa0But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was\\nnot the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of\\nroyalty, this reply disposed of it utterly.\\n\\nMeantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom’s\\nshoulders to the King’s, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight\\nunder it. \\xa0Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King\\nwas anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered\\nthe news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII. Edward as King.\\n\\nMiles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on\\nLondon Bridge--he was more so when he got out of it. \\xa0He had but little\\nmoney when he got in, none at all when he got out. \\xa0The pickpockets had\\nstripped him of his last farthing.\\n\\nBut no matter, so he found his boy. \\xa0Being a soldier, he did not go at\\nhis task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his\\ncampaign.\\n\\nWhat would the boy naturally do? \\xa0Where would he naturally go?\\nWell--argued Miles--he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that\\nis the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well\\nas of sound ones. \\xa0Whereabouts were his former haunts? \\xa0His rags,\\ntaken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even\\nclaimed to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another\\nof the poorest and meanest districts of London. \\xa0Would the search for\\nhim be difficult, or long? \\xa0No, it was likely to be easy and brief. \\xa0He\\nwould not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of\\na big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor\\nlittle friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself\\nwith pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself\\nKing, as usual. \\xa0Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people,\\nand carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving\\nwords, and the two would never be separated any more.\\n\\nSo Miles started on his quest. \\xa0Hour after hour he tramped through back\\nalleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no\\nend of them, but never any sign of the boy. \\xa0This greatly surprised him,\\nbut did not discourage him. \\xa0To his notion, there was nothing the matter\\nwith his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the\\ncampaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be\\nshort.\\n\\nWhen daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed\\nmany a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired,\\nrather hungry and very sleepy. \\xa0He wanted some breakfast, but there was\\nno way to get it. \\xa0To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning\\nhis sword, he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour;\\nhe could spare some of his clothes--yes, but one could as easily find a\\ncustomer for a disease as for such clothes.\\n\\nAt noon he was still tramping--among the rabble which followed after\\nthe royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would\\nattract his little lunatic powerfully. \\xa0He followed the pageant through\\nall its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster\\nand the Abbey. \\xa0He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes\\nthat were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and\\nperplexed, and finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive\\nsome way to better his plan of campaign. \\xa0By-and-by, when he came to\\nhimself out of his musings, he discovered that the town was far behind\\nhim and that the day was growing old. \\xa0He was near the river, and in the\\ncountry; it was a region of fine rural seats--not the sort of district\\nto welcome clothes like his.\\n\\nIt was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee\\nof a hedge to rest and think. \\xa0Drowsiness presently began to settle upon\\nhis senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear,\\nand he said to himself, “The new King is crowned,” and straightway fell\\nasleep. \\xa0He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.\\nHe did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning.\\n\\nHe got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river,\\nstayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward\\nWestminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time.\\n\\xa0Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with\\nold Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and--but that was enough\\nof a plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when\\nthis first stage should be accomplished.\\n\\nToward eleven o’clock he approached the palace; and although a host of\\nshowy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not\\ninconspicuous--his costume took care of that. \\xa0He watched these people’s\\nfaces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might\\nbe willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant--as to trying to get\\ninto the palace himself, that was simply out of the question.\\n\\nPresently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned\\nhis figure well, saying to himself, “An’ that is not the very vagabond\\nhis Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass--though belike I\\nwas that before. \\xa0He answereth the description to a rag--that God should\\nmake two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. \\xa0I\\nwould I could contrive an excuse to speak with him.”\\n\\nMiles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man\\ngenerally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from\\nbehind; and observing a strong interest in the boy’s eyes, he stepped\\ntoward him and said--\\n\\n“You have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?”\\n\\n“Yes, your worship.”\\n\\n“Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?”\\n\\nThe boy started, and said to himself, “Lord! mine old departed father!”\\n Then he answered aloud, “Right well, your worship.”\\n\\n“Good--is he within?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the boy; and added, to himself, “within his grave.”\\n\\n“Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say\\na word in his ear?”\\n\\n“I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir.”\\n\\n“Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without--I shall be\\ngreatly bounden to you, my good lad.”\\n\\nThe boy looked disappointed.  “The King did not name him so,” he said to\\nhimself; “but it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give\\nhis Majesty news of t’other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant.” \\xa0So he said\\nto Miles, “Step in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you\\nword.”\\n\\nHendon retired to the place indicated--it was a recess sunk in the\\npalace wall, with a stone bench in it--a shelter for sentinels in bad\\nweather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge\\nof an officer, passed by. \\xa0The officer saw him, halted his men, and\\ncommanded Hendon to come forth. \\xa0He obeyed, and was promptly arrested\\nas a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace.\\n\\xa0Things began to look ugly. \\xa0Poor Miles was going to explain, but the\\nofficer roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and\\nsearch him.\\n\\n“God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat,” said poor Miles; “I\\nhave searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs.”\\n\\nNothing was found but a document. \\xa0The officer tore it open, and Hendon\\nsmiled when he recognised the ‘pot-hooks’ made by his lost little friend\\nthat black day at Hendon Hall. \\xa0The officer’s face grew dark as he read\\nthe English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he\\nlistened.\\n\\n“Another new claimant of the Crown!” cried the officer.  “Verily they\\nbreed like rabbits, to-day. \\xa0Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep\\nhim fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the\\nKing.”\\n\\nHe hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers.\\n\\n“Now is my evil luck ended at last,” muttered Hendon, “for I shall\\ndangle at a rope’s end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of\\nwriting. \\xa0And what will become of my poor lad!--ah, only the good God\\nknoweth.”\\n\\nBy-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he\\nplucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a\\nman. \\xa0The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his\\nsword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said--\\n\\n“Please you, sir, to follow me.”\\n\\nHendon followed, saying to himself, “An’ I were not travelling to death\\nand judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this\\nknave for his mock courtesy.”\\n\\nThe two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of\\nthe palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into\\nthe hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect\\nand led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows\\nof splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed\\nalong, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately\\nscarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase,\\namong flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room,\\nclove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then\\nmade a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in\\nthe middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant\\nfrowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles.\\n\\nMiles Hendon was entirely bewildered. \\xa0There sat the young King, under\\na canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside,\\nspeaking with a sort of human bird of paradise--a duke, maybe. \\xa0Hendon\\nobserved to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death\\nin the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public\\nhumiliation added. \\xa0He wished the King would hurry about it--some of the\\ngaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive. \\xa0At this moment\\nthe King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his\\nface. The sight nearly took his breath away!--He stood gazing at the\\nfair young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated--\\n\\n“Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!”\\n\\nHe muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then\\nturned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the\\nsplendid saloon, murmuring, “But these are _real_--verily these are\\n_real_--surely it is not a dream.”\\n\\nHe stared at the King again--and thought, “_Is_ it a dream . . . or _is_\\nhe the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom\\no’ Bedlam I took him for--who shall solve me this riddle?”\\n\\nA sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up\\na chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!\\n\\nA buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a\\nvoice exclaimed--\\n\\n“Up, thou mannerless clown! would’st sit in the presence of the King?”\\n\\nThe disturbance attracted his Majesty’s attention, who stretched forth\\nhis hand and cried out--\\n\\n“Touch him not, it is his right!”\\n\\nThe throng fell back, stupefied. \\xa0The King went on--\\n\\n“Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and\\nwell-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and\\nsaved his prince from bodily harm and possible death--and for this he is\\na knight, by the King’s voice. \\xa0Also learn, that for a higher service,\\nin that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon\\nhimself, he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold\\nand lands meet for the dignity. \\xa0More--the privilege which he hath just\\nexercised is his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs\\nof his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the\\nMajesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall\\nendure. \\xa0Molest him not.”\\n\\nTwo persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country\\nduring this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes,\\nstood listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the\\nscarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment.\\n\\xa0These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith. \\xa0But the new Earl did not\\nsee them. \\xa0He was still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and\\nmuttering--\\n\\n“Oh, body o’ me! \\xa0_this_ my pauper! \\xa0This my lunatic! \\xa0This is he whom\\n_I_ would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and\\nseven-and-twenty servants! \\xa0This is he who had never known aught but\\nrags for raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet! \\xa0This is he\\nwhom _I_ adopted and would make respectable! Would God I had a bag to\\nhide my head in!”\\n\\nThen his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his\\nknees, with his hands between the King’s, and swore allegiance and did\\nhomage for his lands and titles. \\xa0Then he rose and stood respectfully\\naside, a mark still for all eyes--and much envy, too.\\n\\nNow the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and\\nkindling eye--\\n\\n“Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him\\nunder lock and key till I have need of him.”\\n\\nThe late Sir Hugh was led away.\\n\\nThere was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell\\napart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between\\nthese living walls, preceded by an usher. \\xa0He knelt before the King, who\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased\\nwith thee. \\xa0Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and\\nmercy. \\xa0Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again? \\xa0Good; they\\nshall be cared for--and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the\\nlaw consent. \\xa0Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they\\nthat abide in the shelter of Christ’s Hospital and share the King’s\\nbounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser\\nparts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its\\nhonourable body of governors, during life. \\xa0And for that he hath been\\na king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due;\\nwherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and\\nnone shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the\\npeople that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his\\ndue of reverence or fail to give him salutation. \\xa0He hath the throne’s\\nprotection, he hath the crown’s support, he shall be known and called by\\nthe honourable title of the King’s Ward.”\\n\\nThe proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King’s hand, and was\\nconducted from the presence. \\xa0He did not waste any time, but flew to his\\nmother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help\\nhim enjoy the great news. {1}\\n\\nConclusion. Justice and retribution.\\n\\nWhen the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by confession of\\nHugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command, that\\nday at Hendon Hall--a command assisted and supported by the perfectly\\ntrustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon,\\nand stand firmly to it, he would have her life; whereupon she said,\\n“Take it!”--she did not value it--and she would not repudiate\\nMiles; then the husband said he would spare her life but have Miles\\nassassinated! \\xa0This was a different matter; so she gave her word and\\nkept it.\\n\\nHugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother’s\\nestates and title, because the wife and brother would not testify\\nagainst him--and the former would not have been allowed to do it, even\\nif she had wanted to. \\xa0Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the\\ncontinent, where he presently died; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent\\nmarried his relict. There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon\\nvillage when the couple paid their first visit to the Hall.\\n\\nTom Canty’s father was never heard of again.\\n\\nThe King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave,\\nand reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler’s gang, and put\\nhim in the way of a comfortable livelihood.\\n\\nHe also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine. He\\nprovided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he\\nsaw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the official who laid the\\nundeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon’s back.\\n\\nHe saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon, and\\nalso the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver; but he\\nwas too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in\\nthe royal forest.\\n\\nHe showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed\\nto have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in\\nthe public esteem and become a great and honoured man.\\n\\nAs long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his\\nadventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him\\naway from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed\\nhimself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey\\nand climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor’s tomb, and then slept\\nso long, next day, that he came within one of missing the Coronation\\naltogether. \\xa0He said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson\\nkept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to\\nhis people; and so, whilst his life was spared he should continue to\\ntell the story, and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his\\nmemory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart.\\n\\nMiles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all through his\\nbrief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The good Earl\\nof Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege; but he\\nexercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was\\ncalled from this world--once at the accession of Queen Mary, and once at\\nthe accession of Queen Elizabeth. \\xa0A descendant of his exercised it\\nat the accession of James I. \\xa0Before this one’s son chose to use the\\nprivilege, near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the ‘privilege\\nof the Kents’ had faded out of most people’s memories; so, when the Kent\\nof that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the\\nsovereign’s presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house,\\nthere was a fine stir indeed! \\xa0But the matter was soon explained, and\\nthe right confirmed. \\xa0The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the\\nCommonwealth fighting for the King, and the odd privilege ended with\\nhim.\\n\\nTom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired old\\nfellow, of grave and benignant aspect. \\xa0As long as he lasted he was\\nhonoured; and he was also reverenced, for his striking and peculiar\\ncostume kept the people reminded that ‘in his time he had been royal;’\\nso, wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart, making way for him, and\\nwhispering, one to another, “Doff thy hat, it is the King’s Ward!”--and\\nso they saluted, and got his kindly smile in return--and they valued it,\\ntoo, for his was an honourable history.\\n\\nYes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived them\\nworthily. \\xa0More than once, when some great dignitary, some gilded vassal\\nof the crown, made argument against his leniency, and urged that some\\nlaw which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose,\\nand wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind,\\nthe young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate\\neyes upon him and answered--\\n\\n“What dost _thou_ know of suffering and oppression? \\xa0I and my people\\nknow, but not thou.”\\n\\nThe reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those harsh\\ntimes. \\xa0Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try to keep this in\\nour minds, to his credit.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES AND TWAIN’S NOTES\\n\\n{1} \\xa0For Mark Twain’s note see below under the relevant chapter heading.\\n\\n{2} \\xa0He refers to the order of baronets, or baronettes; the barones\\nminores, as distinct from the parliamentary barons--not, it need hardly\\nbe said, to the baronets of later creation.\\n\\n{3} \\xa0The lords of Kingsale, descendants of De Courcy, still enjoy this\\ncurious privilege.\\n\\n{4} \\xa0Hume.\\n\\n{5} \\xa0Ib.\\n\\n{6} \\xa0Leigh Hunt’s ‘The Town,’ p.408, quotation from an early tourist.\\n\\n{7} \\xa0Canting terms for various kinds of thieves, beggars and vagabonds,\\nand their female companions.\\n\\n{8} \\xa0From ‘The English Rogue.’ \\xa0London, 1665.\\n\\n{9} \\xa0Hume’s England.\\n\\n{10} \\xa0See Dr. J.

The Whipping-boy.\\n\\nJames I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little\\nfellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their\\nlessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my\\nown purposes.\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XV.\\n\\nCharacter of Hertford.\\n\\nThe young King discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who\\nwas, in the main, a man of moderation and probity.--Hume’s History of\\nEngland, vol. iii, p324.\\n\\nBut if he (the Protector) gave offence by assuming too much state, he\\ndeserves great praise on account of the laws passed this session,\\nby which the rigour of former statutes was much mitigated, and some\\nsecurity given to the freedom of the constitution. \\xa0All laws were\\nrepealed which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the\\ntwenty-fifth of Edward III.; all laws enacted during the late reign\\nextending the crime of felony; all the former laws against Lollardy or\\nheresy, together with the statute of the Six Articles. \\xa0None were to be\\naccused for words, but within a month after they were spoken. \\xa0By\\nthese repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever had passed\\nin England were annulled; and some dawn, both of civil and religious\\nliberty, began to appear to the people. \\xa0A repeal also passed of that\\nlaw, the destruction of all laws, by which the King’s proclamation was\\nmade of equal force with a statute.--Ibid. vol. iii. p. 339.\\n\\nBoiling to Death.\\n\\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. poisoners were, by Act of Parliament,\\ncondemned to be _boiled to death_. \\xa0This Act was repealed in the\\nfollowing reign.\\n\\nIn Germany, even in the seventeenth century, this horrible punishment\\nwas inflicted on coiners and counterfeiters. \\xa0Taylor, the Water Poet,\\ndescribes an execution he witnessed in Hamburg in 1616. \\xa0The judgment\\npronounced against a coiner of false money was that he should ‘_be\\nboiled to death in oil_; not thrown into the vessel at once, but with\\na pulley or rope to be hanged under the armpits, and then let down into\\nthe oil _by degrees_; first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil\\nhis flesh from his bones alive.’--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws,\\nTrue and False, p. 13.\\n\\nThe Famous Stocking Case.\\n\\nA woman and her daughter, _nine years old_, were hanged in Huntingdon\\nfor selling their souls to the devil, and raising a storm by pulling off\\ntheir stockings!--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False,\\np. 20.\\n\\nNOTE 10, Chapter XVII. Enslaving.\\n\\nSo young a King and so ignorant a peasant were likely to make mistakes;\\nand this is an instance in point. \\xa0This peasant was suffering from this\\nlaw _by anticipation_; the King was venting his indignation against a\\nlaw which was not yet in existence; for this hideous statute was to\\nhave birth in this little King’s _own reign_. However, we know, from the\\nhumanity of his character, that it could never have been suggested by\\nhim.\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XXIII. Death for Trifling Larcenies.\\n\\nWhen Connecticut and New Haven were framing their first codes, larceny\\nabove the value of twelve pence was a capital crime in England--as it\\nhad been since the time of Henry I.--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue\\nLaws, True and False, p. 17.\\n\\nThe curious old book called The English Rogue makes the limit thirteen\\npence ha’penny: \\xa0death being the portion of any who steal a thing ‘above\\nthe value of thirteen pence ha’penny.’\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XXVII.\\n\\nFrom many descriptions of larceny the law expressly took away the\\nbenefit of clergy: \\xa0to steal a horse, or a _hawk_, or woollen cloth from\\nthe weaver, was a hanging matter. \\xa0So it was to kill a deer from the\\nKing’s forest, or to export sheep from the kingdom.--Dr. J. Hammond\\nTrumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p.13.\\n\\nWilliam Prynne, a learned barrister, was sentenced (long after Edward\\nVI.’s time) to lose both his ears in the pillory, to degradation from\\nthe bar, a fine of 3,000 pounds, and imprisonment for life. \\xa0Three years\\nafterwards he gave new offence to Laud by publishing a pamphlet against\\nthe hierarchy. \\xa0He was again prosecuted, and was sentenced to lose _what\\nremained of his ears_, to pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, to be _branded on\\nboth his cheeks_ with the letters S. L. (for Seditious Libeller), and to\\nremain in prison for life. \\xa0The severity of this sentence was equalled\\nby the savage rigour of its execution.--Ibid. p. 12.\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XXXIII.\\n\\nChrist’s Hospital, or Bluecoat School, ’the noblest institution in the\\nworld.’\\n\\nThe ground on which the Priory of the Grey Friars stood was conferred\\nby Henry VIII. on the Corporation of London (who caused the institution\\nthere of a home for poor boys and girls). Subsequently, Edward VI.\\ncaused the old Priory to be properly repaired, and founded within\\nit that noble establishment called the Bluecoat School, or Christ’s\\nHospital, for the _education_ and maintenance of orphans and the\\nchildren of indigent persons . . . Edward would not let him (Bishop\\nRidley) depart till the letter was written (to the Lord Mayor), and then\\ncharged him to deliver it himself, and signify his special request and\\ncommandment that no time might be lost in proposing what was convenient,\\nand apprising him of the proceedings. \\xa0The work was zealously\\nundertaken, Ridley himself engaging in it; and the result was the\\nfounding of Christ’s Hospital for the education of poor children. (The\\nKing endowed several other charities at the same time.) “Lord God,” said\\nhe, “I yield Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast given me life thus\\nlong to finish this work to the glory of Thy name!” \\xa0That innocent and\\nmost exemplary life was drawing rapidly to its close, and in a few days\\nhe rendered up his spirit to his Creator, praying God to defend the\\nrealm from Papistry.--J. Heneage Jesse’s London: \\xa0its Celebrated\\nCharacters and Places.\\n\\nIn the Great Hall hangs a large picture of King Edward VI. seated on his\\nthrone, in a scarlet and ermined robe, holding the sceptre in his left\\nhand, and presenting with the other the Charter to the kneeling Lord\\nMayor. \\xa0By his side stands the Chancellor, holding the seals, and next\\nto him are other officers of state. \\xa0Bishop Ridley kneels before him\\nwith uplifted hands, as if supplicating a blessing on the event; whilst\\nthe Aldermen, etc., with the Lord Mayor, kneel on both sides, occupying\\nthe middle ground of the picture; and lastly, in front, are a double row\\nof boys on one side and girls on the other, from the master and matron\\ndown to the boy and girl who have stepped forward from their respective\\nrows, and kneel with raised hands before the King.--Timbs’ Curiosities\\nof London, p. 98.\\n\\nChrist’s Hospital, by ancient custom, possesses the privilege of\\naddressing the Sovereign on the occasion of his or her coming into the\\nCity to partake of the hospitality of the Corporation of London.--Ibid.\\n\\nThe Dining Hall, with its lobby and organ-gallery, occupies the entire\\nstorey, which is 187 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 47 feet high; it is\\nlit by nine large windows, filled with stained glass on the south side;\\nand is, next to Westminster Hall, the noblest room in the metropolis.\\n\\xa0Here the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the\\n‘Suppings in Public,’ to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued\\nby the Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ’s Hospital. \\xa0The tables\\nare laid with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured\\nfrom leathern jacks, and bread brought in large baskets. \\xa0The official\\ncompany enter; the Lord Mayor, or President, takes his seat in a state\\nchair made of oak from St. Catherine’s Church, by the Tower; a hymn\\nis sung, accompanied by the organ; a ‘Grecian,’ or head boy, reads the\\nprayers from the pulpit, silence being enforced by three drops of a\\nwooden hammer. \\xa0After prayer the supper commences, and the visitors walk\\nbetween the tables. \\xa0At its close the ’trade-boys’ take up the baskets,\\nbowls, jacks, piggins, and candlesticks, and pass in procession, the\\nbowing to the Governors being curiously formal. \\xa0This spectacle was\\nwitnessed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1845.\\n\\nAmong the more eminent Bluecoat boys are Joshua Barnes, editor\\nof Anacreon and Euripides; Jeremiah Markland, the eminent critic,\\nparticularly in Greek Literature; Camden, the antiquary; Bishop\\nStillingfleet; Samuel Richardson, the novelist; Thomas Mitchell, the\\ntranslator of Aristophanes; Thomas Barnes, many years editor of the\\nLondon Times; Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.\\n\\nNo boy is admitted before he is seven years old, or after he is nine;\\nand no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King’s boys and\\n‘Grecians’ alone excepted. \\xa0There are about 500 Governors, at the head\\nof whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales. \\xa0The qualification\\nfor a Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.\\n\\nGENERAL NOTE.\\n\\nOne hears much about the ‘hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,’ and is\\naccustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned. \\xa0There are people\\nin America--and even in England!--who imagine that they were a very\\nmonument of malignity, pitilessness, and inhumanity; whereas in reality\\nthey were about the first _sweeping departure from judicial atrocity_\\nwhich the ‘civilised’ world had seen. \\xa0This humane and kindly Blue Law\\nCode, of two hundred and forty years ago, stands all by itself,\\nwith ages of bloody law on the further side of it, and a century and\\nthree-quarters of bloody English law on _this_ side of it.\\n\\nThere has never been a time--under the Blue Laws or any other--when\\nabove _fourteen_ crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut. \\xa0But in\\nEngland, within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind,\\n_two hundred and twenty-three_ crimes were punishable by death! {10}\\n\\xa0These facts are worth knowing--and worth thinking about, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince and The Pauper,\\nComplete by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRINCE AND THE PAUPER ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1837-0.txt or 1837-0.zip ***** This and\\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/3/1837/\\n\\nProduced by David Widger.

The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.\\n\\nIn the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second\\nquarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the\\nname of Canty, who did not want him. \\xa0On the same day another English\\nchild was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.\\nAll England wanted him too. \\xa0England had so longed for him, and hoped\\nfor him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the\\npeople went nearly mad for joy. \\xa0Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed\\neach other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich\\nand poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they\\nkept this up for days and nights together. \\xa0By day, London was a sight\\nto see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and\\nsplendid pageants marching along. \\xa0By night, it was again a sight\\nto see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of\\nrevellers making merry around them. \\xa0There was no talk in all England\\nbut of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in\\nsilks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that\\ngreat lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not\\ncaring, either. \\xa0But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty,\\nlapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had\\njust come to trouble with his presence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II. Tom’s early life.\\n\\nLet us skip a number of years.\\n\\nLondon was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that\\nday. It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.\\n\\xa0The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the\\npart where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. \\xa0The\\nhouses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first,\\nand the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. \\xa0The higher\\nthe houses grew, the broader they grew. \\xa0They were skeletons of strong\\ncriss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.\\n\\xa0The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner’s\\ntaste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look. \\xa0The windows\\nwere small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened\\noutward, on hinges, like doors.\\n\\nThe house which Tom’s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called\\nOffal Court, out of Pudding Lane. \\xa0It was small, decayed, and rickety,\\nbut it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty’s tribe\\noccupied a room on the third floor. \\xa0The mother and father had a sort of\\nbedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,\\nBet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,\\nand might sleep where they chose. \\xa0There were the remains of a blanket\\nor two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not\\nrightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked\\ninto a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at\\nnight, for service.\\n\\nBet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins. \\xa0They were good-hearted\\ngirls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant. \\xa0Their mother\\nwas like them. \\xa0But the father and the grandmother were a couple of\\nfiends. \\xa0They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other\\nor anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk\\nor sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. \\xa0They made\\nbeggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them. \\xa0Among,\\nbut not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old\\npriest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of\\na few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them\\nright ways secretly. Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and\\nhow to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls,\\nbut they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have\\nendured such a queer accomplishment in them.\\n\\nAll Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty’s house.\\nDrunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and\\nnearly all night long. \\xa0Broken heads were as common as hunger in that\\nplace. \\xa0Yet little Tom was not unhappy. \\xa0He had a hard time of it, but\\ndid not know it. \\xa0It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys\\nhad, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.\\n\\xa0When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would\\ncurse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful\\ngrandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away\\nin the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any\\nmiserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going\\nhungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of\\ntreason and soundly beaten for it by her husband.\\n\\nNo, Tom’s life went along well enough, especially in summer. \\xa0He only\\nbegged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were\\nstringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time\\nlistening to good Father Andrew’s charming old tales and legends\\nabout giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and\\ngorgeous kings and princes. \\xa0His head grew to be full of these wonderful\\nthings, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and\\noffensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he\\nunleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in\\ndelicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince\\nin a regal palace. \\xa0One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:\\n\\xa0it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes. \\xa0He spoke of it once to\\nsome of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so\\nunmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.\\n\\nHe often read the priest’s old books and got him to explain and enlarge\\nupon them. \\xa0His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,\\nby-and-by. \\xa0His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his\\nshabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.\\n\\xa0He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but,\\ninstead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it,\\nhe began to find an added value in it because of the washings and\\ncleansings it afforded.\\n\\nTom could always find something going on around the Maypole in\\nCheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London\\nhad a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was\\ncarried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer’s day he saw\\npoor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and\\nheard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.\\nYes, Tom’s life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.\\n\\nBy-and-by Tom’s reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a\\nstrong effect upon him that he began to _act_ the prince, unconsciously.\\nHis speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the\\nvast admiration and amusement of his intimates. \\xa0But Tom’s influence\\namong these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he\\ncame to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a\\nsuperior being. \\xa0He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such\\nmarvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise! \\xa0Tom’s remarks,\\nand Tom’s performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and\\nthese, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him\\nas a most gifted and extraordinary creature. \\xa0Full-grown people brought\\ntheir perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the\\nwit and wisdom of his decisions. \\xa0In fact he was become a hero to all\\nwho knew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.\\n\\nPrivately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! \\xa0He was the\\nprince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords\\nand ladies in waiting, and the royal family. \\xa0Daily the mock prince was\\nreceived with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic\\nreadings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed\\nin the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his\\nimaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.\\n\\nAfter which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat\\nhis poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch\\nhimself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs\\nin his dreams.\\n\\nAnd still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,\\ngrew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed\\nall other desires, and became the one passion of his life.\\n\\nOne January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up\\nand down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour\\nafter hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and\\nlonging for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed\\nthere--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,\\njudging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to\\nown and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was\\nmurky; it was a melancholy day. \\xa0At night Tom reached home so wet and\\ntired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother\\nto observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;\\nwherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.\\n\\xa0For a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting\\ngoing on in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts\\ndrifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company\\nof jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had\\nservants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders. \\xa0And\\nthen, as usual, he dreamed that _he_ was a princeling himself.\\n\\nAll night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved\\namong great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,\\ndrinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of\\nthe glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a\\nsmile, and there a nod of his princely head.\\n\\nAnd when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness\\nabout him, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the\\nsordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold. \\xa0Then came bitterness,\\nand heart-break, and tears.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III. Tom’s meeting with the Prince.\\n\\nTom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy\\nwith the shadowy splendours of his night’s dreams. He wandered here\\nand there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what\\nwas happening around him. \\xa0People jostled him, and some gave him rough\\nspeech; but it was all lost on the musing boy. \\xa0By-and-by he found\\nhimself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in\\nthat direction. \\xa0He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his\\nimaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London. \\xa0The Strand\\nhad ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,\\nbut by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably\\ncompact row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered\\ngreat buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with\\nample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are\\nnow closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.\\n\\nTom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the\\nbeautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then\\nidled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal’s\\nstately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace\\nbeyond--Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of\\nmasonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and turrets,\\nthe huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its magnificent array\\nof colossal granite lions, and other the signs and symbols of English\\nroyalty. \\xa0Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last? \\xa0Here,\\nindeed, was a king’s palace. \\xa0Might he not hope to see a prince now--a\\nprince of flesh and blood, if Heaven were willing?\\n\\nAt each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say,\\nan erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel\\nin shining steel armour. \\xa0At a respectful distance were many country\\nfolk, and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of\\nroyalty that might offer. \\xa0Splendid carriages, with splendid people\\nin them and splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by\\nseveral other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.\\n\\nPoor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and\\ntimidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when\\nall at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that\\nalmost made him shout for joy. \\xa0Within was a comely boy, tanned and\\nbrown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all\\nof lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little\\njewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;\\nand on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened\\nwith a great sparkling gem. \\xa0Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his\\nservants, without a doubt. \\xa0Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living\\nprince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer\\nof the pauper-boy’s heart was answered at last.\\n\\nTom’s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big\\nwith wonder and delight. \\xa0Everything gave way in his mind instantly\\nto one desire: \\xa0that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,\\ndevouring look at him. \\xa0Before he knew what he was about, he had his\\nface against the gate-bars. \\xa0The next instant one of the soldiers\\nsnatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd\\nof country gawks and London idlers. \\xa0The soldier said,--\\n\\n“Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!”\\n\\nThe crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate\\nwith his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried\\nout,--\\n\\n“How dar’st thou use a poor lad like that? \\xa0How dar’st thou use the King\\nmy father’s meanest subject so? \\xa0Open the gates, and let him in!”\\n\\nYou should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then.\\nYou should have heard them cheer, and shout, “Long live the Prince of\\nWales!”\\n\\nThe soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates,\\nand presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his\\nfluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.\\n\\nEdward Tudor said--\\n\\n“Thou lookest tired and hungry: \\xa0thou’st been treated ill. \\xa0Come with\\nme.”\\n\\nHalf a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don’t know what; interfere,\\nno doubt. \\xa0But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and\\nthey stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues. \\xa0Edward\\ntook Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.\\n\\xa0By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered\\nbefore except in books. \\xa0The prince, with princely delicacy and\\nbreeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be\\nembarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked\\nquestions while Tom ate.\\n\\n“What is thy name, lad?”\\n\\n“Tom Canty, an’ it please thee, sir.”\\n\\n“‘Tis an odd one. \\xa0Where dost live?”\\n\\n“In the city, please thee, sir. \\xa0Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.”\\n\\n“Offal Court! \\xa0Truly ’tis another odd one. \\xa0Hast parents?”\\n\\n“Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently\\nprecious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin\\nsisters, Nan and Bet.”\\n\\n“Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?”\\n\\n“Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. \\xa0She hath a wicked\\nheart, and worketh evil all her days.”\\n\\n“Doth she mistreat thee?”\\n\\n“There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with\\ndrink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to\\nme with goodly beatings.”\\n\\nA fierce look came into the little prince’s eyes, and he cried out--\\n\\n“What! \\xa0Beatings?”\\n\\n“Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.”\\n\\n“_Beatings_!--and thou so frail and little. \\xa0Hark ye: \\xa0before the night\\ncome, she shall hie her to the Tower. \\xa0The King my father”--\\n\\n“In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. \\xa0The Tower is for the great\\nalone.”\\n\\n“True, indeed. \\xa0I had not thought of that. \\xa0I will consider of her\\npunishment. \\xa0Is thy father kind to thee?”\\n\\n“Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”\\n\\n“Fathers be alike, mayhap. \\xa0Mine hath not a doll’s temper. \\xa0He smiteth\\nwith a heavy hand, yet spareth me: \\xa0he spareth me not always with his\\ntongue, though, sooth to say. \\xa0How doth thy mother use thee?”\\n\\n“She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.\\nAnd Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”\\n\\n“How old be these?”\\n\\n“Fifteen, an’ it please you, sir.”\\n\\n“The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey,\\nmy cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but\\nmy sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you: \\xa0do thy\\nsisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their\\nsouls?”\\n\\n“They? \\xa0Oh, dost think, sir, that _they_ have servants?”\\n\\nThe little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then\\nsaid--\\n\\n“And prithee, why not? \\xa0Who helpeth them undress at night? \\xa0Who attireth\\nthem when they rise?”\\n\\n“None, sir. \\xa0Would’st have them take off their garment, and sleep\\nwithout--like the beasts?”\\n\\n“Their garment! \\xa0Have they but one?”\\n\\n“Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more? \\xa0Truly they have\\nnot two bodies each.”\\n\\n“It is a quaint and marvellous thought! \\xa0Thy pardon, I had not meant\\nto laugh. \\xa0But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys\\nenow, and that soon, too: \\xa0my cofferer shall look to it. \\xa0No, thank me\\nnot; ’tis nothing. \\xa0Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.\\n\\xa0Art learned?”\\n\\n“I know not if I am or not, sir. \\xa0The good priest that is called Father\\nAndrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.”\\n\\n“Know’st thou the Latin?”\\n\\n“But scantly, sir, I doubt.”\\n\\n“Learn it, lad:  ’tis hard only at first. \\xa0The Greek is harder; but\\nneither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady\\nElizabeth and my cousin. \\xa0Thou should’st hear those damsels at it! \\xa0But\\ntell me of thy Offal Court. \\xa0Hast thou a pleasant life there?”\\n\\n“In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There\\nbe Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so\\nbravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout\\nand fight till all are slain, and ’tis so fine to see, and costeth but\\na farthing--albeit ’tis main hard to get the farthing, please your\\nworship.”\\n\\n“Tell me more.”\\n\\n“We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,\\nlike to the fashion of the ‘prentices, sometimes.”\\n\\nThe prince’s eyes flashed. \\xa0Said he--\\n\\n“Marry, that would not I mislike. \\xa0Tell me more.”\\n\\n“We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.”\\n\\n“That would I like also. \\xa0Speak on.”\\n\\n“In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and\\neach doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and\\nshout and tumble and--”\\n\\n“‘Twould be worth my father’s kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go\\non.”\\n\\n“We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,\\neach covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh\\nthe lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the\\nworld!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship’s\\npresence.”\\n\\n“Oh, prithee, say no more, ’tis glorious! \\xa0If that I could but clothe me\\nin raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,\\njust once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego\\nthe crown!”\\n\\n“And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just\\nonce--”\\n\\n“Oho, would’st like it? \\xa0Then so shall it be. \\xa0Doff thy rags, and don\\nthese splendours, lad! \\xa0It is a brief happiness, but will be not less\\nkeen for that. \\xa0We will have it while we may, and change again before\\nany come to molest.”\\n\\nA few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom’s\\nfluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked\\nout in the gaudy plumage of royalty. \\xa0The two went and stood side by\\nside before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to\\nhave been any change made! \\xa0They stared at each other, then at the\\nglass, then at each other again. \\xa0At last the puzzled princeling said--\\n\\n“What dost thou make of this?”\\n\\n“Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. \\xa0It is not meet that\\none of my degree should utter the thing.”\\n\\n“Then will _I_ utter it. \\xa0Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the\\nsame voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and\\ncountenance that I bear. \\xa0Fared we forth naked, there is none could\\nsay which was you, and which the Prince of Wales. \\xa0And, now that I\\nam clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more\\nnearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not\\nthis a bruise upon your hand?”\\n\\n“Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor\\nman-at-arms--”\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0It was a shameful thing and a cruel!” cried the little prince,\\nstamping his bare foot.  “If the King--Stir not a step till I come\\nagain! It is a command!”\\n\\nIn a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national\\nimportance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying\\nthrough the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and\\nglowing eyes. \\xa0As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,\\nand tried to shake them, shouting--\\n\\n“Open! \\xa0Unbar the gates!”\\n\\nThe soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince\\nburst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier\\nfetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the\\nroadway, and said--\\n\\n“Take that, thou beggar’s spawn, for what thou got’st me from his\\nHighness!”\\n\\nThe crowd roared with laughter. \\xa0The prince picked himself out of the\\nmud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--\\n\\n“I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for\\nlaying thy hand upon me!”\\n\\nThe soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--\\n\\n“I salute your gracious Highness.” \\xa0Then angrily--“Be off, thou crazy\\nrubbish!”\\n\\nHere the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled\\nhim far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--\\n\\n“Way for his Royal Highness! \\xa0Way for the Prince of Wales!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV. The Prince’s troubles begin.\\n\\nAfter hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was\\nat last deserted by the rabble and left to himself. \\xa0As long as he had\\nbeen able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and\\nroyally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very\\nentertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was\\nno longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.\\nHe looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality. \\xa0He\\nwas within the city of London--that was all he knew. \\xa0He moved on,\\naimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by\\nwere infrequent. \\xa0He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed\\nthen where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed\\non, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered\\nhouses in it, and a prodigious church. \\xa0He recognised this church.\\n\\xa0Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was\\nundergoing elaborate repairs. \\xa0The prince took heart at once--he felt\\nthat his troubles were at an end, now. \\xa0He said to himself, “It is the\\nancient Grey Friars’ Church, which the king my father hath taken from\\nthe monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children,\\nand new-named it Christ’s Church. \\xa0Right gladly will they serve the son\\nof him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son\\nis himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this\\nday, or ever shall be.”\\n\\nHe was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,\\nplaying at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and\\nright noisily, too. \\xa0They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion\\nwhich in that day prevailed among serving-men and ‘prentices{1}--that\\nis to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the\\nsize of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such\\nscanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair\\nfell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight\\naround; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely\\nand hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt;\\nbright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large\\nmetal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.\\n\\nThe boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with\\nnative dignity--\\n\\n“Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth\\nspeech with him.”\\n\\nA great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--\\n\\n“Marry, art thou his grace’s messenger, beggar?”\\n\\nThe prince’s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his\\nhip, but there was nothing there. \\xa0There was a storm of laughter, and\\none boy said--\\n\\n“Didst mark that? \\xa0He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince\\nhimself.”\\n\\nThis sally brought more laughter. \\xa0Poor Edward drew himself up proudly\\nand said--\\n\\n“I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my\\nfather’s bounty to use me so.”\\n\\nThis was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. \\xa0The youth who had\\nfirst spoken, shouted to his comrades--\\n\\n“Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace’s princely father, where be\\nyour manners? \\xa0Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to\\nhis kingly port and royal rags!”\\n\\nWith boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did\\nmock homage to their prey. \\xa0The prince spurned the nearest boy with his\\nfoot, and said fiercely--\\n\\n“Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!”\\n\\nAh, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun. \\xa0The laughter\\nceased on the instant, and fury took its place. \\xa0A dozen shouted--\\n\\n“Hale him forth! \\xa0To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond! \\xa0Where be the\\ndogs? \\xa0Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!”\\n\\nThen followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred\\nperson of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and\\nset upon and torn by dogs.\\n\\nAs night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in\\nthe close-built portion of the city. \\xa0His body was bruised, his hands\\nwere bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud. \\xa0He wandered\\non and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint\\nhe could hardly drag one foot after the other. \\xa0He had ceased to ask\\nquestions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of\\ninformation. \\xa0He kept muttering to himself, “Offal Court--that is the\\nname; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I\\ndrop, then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and\\nprove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have\\nmine own again.” \\xa0And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment\\nby those rude Christ’s Hospital boys, and he said, “When I am king, they\\nshall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books;\\nfor a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the\\nheart. \\xa0I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day’s\\nlesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning\\nsofteneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.” {1}\\n\\nThe lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a\\nraw and gusty night set in. \\xa0The houseless prince, the homeless heir to\\nthe throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze\\nof squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were\\nmassed together.\\n\\nSuddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--\\n\\n“Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home,\\nI warrant me! \\xa0If it be so, an’ I do not break all the bones in thy lean\\nbody, then am I not John Canty, but some other.”\\n\\nThe prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned\\nshoulder, and eagerly said--\\n\\n“Oh, art _his_ father, truly? \\xa0Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt\\nthou fetch him away and restore me!”\\n\\n“_His_ father? \\xa0I know not what thou mean’st; I but know I am _thy_\\nfather, as thou shalt soon have cause to--”\\n\\n“Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can\\nbear no more. \\xa0Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich\\nbeyond thy wildest dreams. \\xa0Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no\\nlie, but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me! \\xa0I am indeed\\nthe Prince of Wales!”\\n\\nThe man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and\\nmuttered--\\n\\n“Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam!”--then collared him once more,\\nand said with a coarse laugh and an oath, “But mad or no mad, I and thy\\nGammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or\\nI’m no true man!”\\n\\nWith this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and\\ndisappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of\\nhuman vermin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician.\\n\\nTom Canty, left alone in the prince’s cabinet, made good use of his\\nopportunity. \\xa0He turned himself this way and that before the great\\nmirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince’s\\nhigh-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. \\xa0Next he\\ndrew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it\\nacross his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to\\nthe lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering\\nthe great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. \\xa0Tom\\nplayed with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined\\nthe costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the\\nsumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court\\nherd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. \\xa0He wondered if\\nthey would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home,\\nor if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination\\nhad at last upset his reason.\\n\\nAt the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince\\nwas gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very\\nsoon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the\\npretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.\\nSuppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince’s clothes, and\\nthe prince not there to explain. \\xa0Might they not hang him at once,\\nand inquire into his case afterward? \\xa0He had heard that the great\\nwere prompt about small matters. \\xa0His fear rose higher and higher; and\\ntrembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to\\nfly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release. \\xa0Six\\ngorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed\\nlike butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him. \\xa0He\\nstepped quickly back and shut the door. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“Oh, they mock at me! \\xa0They will go and tell. \\xa0Oh! why came I here to\\ncast away my life?”\\n\\nHe walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening,\\nstarting at every trifling sound. \\xa0Presently the door swung open, and a\\nsilken page said--\\n\\n“The Lady Jane Grey.”\\n\\nThe door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.\\nBut she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice--\\n\\n“Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?”\\n\\nTom’s breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out--\\n\\n“Ah, be merciful, thou! \\xa0In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty\\nof Offal Court in the city. \\xa0Prithee let me see the prince, and he will\\nof his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt. \\xa0Oh, be\\nthou merciful, and save me!”\\n\\nBy this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes\\nand uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. \\xa0The young girl seemed\\nhorror-stricken. \\xa0She cried out--\\n\\n“O my lord, on thy knees?--and to _me_!”\\n\\nThen she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down,\\nmurmuring--\\n\\n“There is no help, there is no hope. \\xa0Now will they come and take me.”\\n\\nWhilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding\\nthrough the palace. \\xa0The whisper--for it was whispered always--flew from\\nmenial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from\\nstory to story, from saloon to saloon, “The prince hath gone mad, the\\nprince hath gone mad!” \\xa0Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its\\ngroups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling\\nlesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face\\nhad in it dismay. Presently a splendid official came marching by these\\ngroups, making solemn proclamation--\\n\\n“IN THE NAME OF THE KING!\\n\\nLet none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor\\ndiscuss the same, nor carry it abroad. \\xa0In the name of the King!”\\n\\nThe whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been\\nstricken dumb.\\n\\nSoon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of “The prince! See,\\nthe prince comes!”\\n\\nPoor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to\\nbow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with\\nbewildered and pathetic eyes. \\xa0Great nobles walked upon each side of\\nhim, making him lean upon them, and so steady his steps. Behind him\\nfollowed the court-physicians and some servants.\\n\\nPresently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard\\nthe door close behind him. \\xa0Around him stood those who had come with\\nhim. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very\\nfat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression. \\xa0His large\\nhead was very grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his\\nface, like a frame, were grey also. \\xa0His clothing was of rich stuff,\\nbut old, and slightly frayed in places. \\xa0One of his swollen legs had a\\npillow under it, and was wrapped in bandages. \\xa0There was silence now;\\nand there was no head there but was bent in reverence, except this\\nman’s. \\xa0This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII. \\xa0He\\nsaid--and his face grew gentle as he began to speak--\\n\\n“How now, my lord Edward, my prince? \\xa0Hast been minded to cozen me, the\\ngood King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a\\nsorry jest?”\\n\\nPoor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him,\\nto the beginning of this speech; but when the words ‘me, the good King’\\nfell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon\\nhis knees as if a shot had brought him there. Lifting up his hands, he\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“Thou the _King_? \\xa0Then am I undone indeed!”\\n\\nThis speech seemed to stun the King. \\xa0His eyes wandered from face to\\nface aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him. \\xa0Then\\nhe said in a tone of deep disappointment--\\n\\n“Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I\\nfear me ’tis not so.” \\xa0He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle\\nvoice, “Come to thy father, child: \\xa0thou art not well.”\\n\\nTom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England,\\nhumble and trembling. \\xa0The King took the frightened face between his\\nhands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking\\nsome grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly\\nhead against his breast, and patted it tenderly. \\xa0Presently he said--\\n\\n“Dost not know thy father, child? \\xa0Break not mine old heart; say thou\\nknow’st me. \\xa0Thou _dost_ know me, dost thou not?”\\n\\n“Yea: \\xa0thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!”\\n\\n“True, true--that is well--be comforted, tremble not so; there is none\\nhere would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou art better\\nnow; thy ill dream passeth--is’t not so? \\xa0Thou wilt not miscall thyself\\nagain, as they say thou didst a little while agone?”\\n\\n“I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most\\ndread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper\\nborn, and ’tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was\\ntherein nothing blameful. \\xa0I am but young to die, and thou canst save me\\nwith one little word. \\xa0Oh speak it, sir!”\\n\\n“Die? \\xa0Talk not so, sweet prince--peace, peace, to thy troubled\\nheart--thou shalt not die!”\\n\\nTom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry--\\n\\n“God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy\\nland!” Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords\\nin waiting, and exclaimed, “Thou heard’st it! \\xa0I am not to die: \\xa0the\\nKing hath said it!” \\xa0There was no movement, save that all bowed with\\ngrave respect; but no one spoke. \\xa0He hesitated, a little confused, then\\nturned timidly toward the King, saying, “I may go now?”\\n\\n“Go? \\xa0Surely, if thou desirest. \\xa0But why not tarry yet a little? Whither\\nwould’st go?”\\n\\nTom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly--\\n\\n“Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved\\nto seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which\\nharboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these\\npomps and splendours whereunto I am not used--oh, please you, sir, to\\nlet me go!”\\n\\nThe King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a\\ngrowing distress and uneasiness. \\xa0Presently he said, with something of\\nhope in his voice--\\n\\n“Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits\\nunmarred as toucheth other matter. \\xa0God send it may be so! \\xa0We will make\\ntrial.”\\n\\nThen he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in\\nthe same tongue. \\xa0The lords and doctors manifested their gratification\\nalso. The King said--\\n\\n“‘Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his\\nmind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. \\xa0How say you, sir?”\\n\\nThe physician addressed bowed low, and replied--\\n\\n“It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined\\naright.”\\n\\nThe King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from\\nso excellent authority, and continued with good heart--\\n\\n“Now mark ye all: \\xa0we will try him further.”\\n\\nHe put a question to Tom in French. \\xa0Tom stood silent a moment,\\nembarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said\\ndiffidently--\\n\\n“I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty.”\\n\\nThe King fell back upon his couch. \\xa0The attendants flew to his\\nassistance; but he put them aside, and said--\\n\\n“Trouble me not--it is nothing but a scurvy faintness. \\xa0Raise me! There,\\n‘tis sufficient. \\xa0Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head\\nupon thy father’s heart, and be at peace. \\xa0Thou’lt soon be well:  ’tis\\nbut a passing fantasy. \\xa0Fear thou not; thou’lt soon be well.” \\xa0Then\\nhe turned toward the company: \\xa0his gentle manner changed, and baleful\\nlightnings began to play from his eyes. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“List ye all! \\xa0This my son is mad; but it is not permanent. \\xa0Over-study\\nhath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement. \\xa0Away with his\\nbooks and teachers! see ye to it. \\xa0Pleasure him with sports, beguile him\\nin wholesome ways, so that his health come again.” \\xa0He raised himself\\nhigher still, and went on with energy, “He is mad; but he is my son,\\nand England’s heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! \\xa0And hear ye\\nfurther, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh\\nagainst the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!\\n. . . Give me to drink--I burn: \\xa0this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . .\\nThere, take away the cup. . . . Support me. \\xa0There, that is well. \\xa0Mad,\\nis he? \\xa0Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I\\nthe King will confirm it. \\xa0This very morrow shall he be installed in his\\nprincely dignity in due and ancient form. \\xa0Take instant order for it, my\\nlord Hertford.”\\n\\nOne of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said--\\n\\n“The King’s majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England\\nlieth attainted in the Tower. \\xa0It were not meet that one attainted--”\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0Insult not mine ears with his hated name. \\xa0Is this man to\\nlive for ever? \\xa0Am I to be baulked of my will? \\xa0Is the prince to tarry\\nuninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal\\nfree of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the\\nsplendour of God! \\xa0Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk’s doom before\\nthe sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!” {1}\\n\\nLord Hertford said--\\n\\n“The King’s will is law;” and, rising, returned to his former place.\\n\\nGradually the wrath faded out of the old King’s face, and he said--\\n\\n“Kiss me, my prince. \\xa0There . . . what fearest thou? \\xa0Am I not thy\\nloving father?”\\n\\n“Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that\\nin truth I know. \\xa0But--but--it grieveth me to think of him that is to\\ndie, and--”\\n\\n“Ah, ’tis like thee, ’tis like thee! \\xa0I know thy heart is still the\\nsame, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a\\ngentle spirit. \\xa0But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours:\\n\\xa0I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great\\noffice. Comfort thee, my prince: \\xa0trouble not thy poor head with this\\nmatter.”\\n\\n“But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? \\xa0How long might he not\\nlive, but for me?”\\n\\n“Take no thought of him, my prince: \\xa0he is not worthy. \\xa0Kiss me once\\nagain, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth\\nme. \\xa0I am aweary, and would rest. \\xa0Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy\\npeople, and come again when my body is refreshed.”\\n\\nTom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last\\nsentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would\\nbe set free. \\xa0Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, “The\\nprince, the prince comes!”\\n\\nHis spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering\\nfiles of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a\\ncaptive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a\\nforlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him\\nand set him free.\\n\\nAnd, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the\\nsevered head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the\\neyes fixed on him reproachfully.\\n\\nHis old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI. Tom receives instructions.\\n\\nTom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made\\nto sit down--a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly\\nmen and men of high degree about him. \\xa0He begged them to be seated\\nalso, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained\\nstanding. He would have insisted, but his ‘uncle’ the Earl of Hertford\\nwhispered in his ear--\\n\\n“Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy\\npresence.”\\n\\nThe Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I come upon the King’s errand, concerning a matter which requireth\\nprivacy. \\xa0Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend\\nyou here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?”\\n\\nObserving that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford\\nwhispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to\\nspeak unless he chose. \\xa0When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St.\\nJohn said--\\n\\n“His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the\\nprince’s grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his\\npower, till it be passed and he be as he was before. \\xa0To wit, that he\\nshall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England’s\\ngreatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive,\\nwithout word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which\\nunto it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to\\nspeak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured\\nout of the unwholesome imaginings of o’er-wrought fancy; that he shall\\nstrive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which\\nhe was wont to know--and where he faileth he shall hold his peace,\\nneither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath\\nforgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall\\nperplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should\\nmake, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but\\ntake advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self,\\nwhich are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at\\ncall, till this commandment be dissolved. Thus saith the King’s majesty,\\nwho sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will\\nof His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy\\nkeeping.”\\n\\nThe Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside. \\xa0Tom replied\\nresignedly--\\n\\n“The King hath said it. \\xa0None may palter with the King’s command, or fit\\nit to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall\\nbe obeyed.”\\n\\nLord Hertford said--\\n\\n“Touching the King’s majesty’s ordainment concerning books and such like\\nserious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your\\ntime with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet\\nand suffer harm thereby.”\\n\\nTom’s face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw\\nLord St. John’s eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. \\xa0His lordship said--\\n\\n“Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise--but\\nsuffer it not to trouble thee, for ’tis a matter that will not bide,\\nbut depart with thy mending malady. \\xa0My Lord of Hertford speaketh of\\nthe city’s banquet which the King’s majesty did promise, some two months\\nflown, your highness should attend. \\xa0Thou recallest it now?”\\n\\n“It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,” said Tom, in a\\nhesitating voice; and blushed again.\\n\\nAt this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.\\nThe two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped\\nquickly toward the door. \\xa0As the young girls passed him, he said in a\\nlow voice--\\n\\n“I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise\\nwhen his memory doth lapse--it will grieve you to note how it doth stick\\nat every trifle.”\\n\\nMeantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom’s ear--\\n\\n“Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty’s desire. Remember\\nall thou canst--_seem_ to remember all else. \\xa0Let them not perceive that\\nthou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy\\nold play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how ’twould grieve them.\\nArt willing, sir, that I remain?--and thine uncle?”\\n\\nTom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was\\nalready learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself\\nas best he might, according to the King’s command.\\n\\nIn spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people\\nbecame a little embarrassing at times. \\xa0More than once, in truth,\\nTom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his\\ntremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a\\nword from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently\\nby chance, had the same happy effect. \\xa0Once the little Lady Jane turned\\nto Tom and dismayed him with this question,--\\n\\n“Hast paid thy duty to the Queen’s majesty to-day, my lord?”\\n\\nTom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something\\nat hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him\\nwith the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate\\ndifficulties and to be ready for them--\\n\\n“He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his\\nmajesty’s condition; is it not so, your highness?”\\n\\nTom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was\\ngetting upon dangerous ground. \\xa0Somewhat later it was mentioned that\\nTom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“‘Tis a pity, ’tis a pity! \\xa0Thou wert proceeding bravely. \\xa0But bide thy\\ntime in patience: \\xa0it will not be for long. \\xa0Thou’lt yet be graced\\nwith learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many\\nlanguages as his, good my prince.”\\n\\n“My father!” cried Tom, off his guard for the moment.  “I trow he cannot\\nspeak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may\\ntell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever--”\\n\\nHe looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John’s\\neyes.\\n\\nHe stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: “Ah, my malady\\npersecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth. \\xa0I meant the King’s grace\\nno irreverence.”\\n\\n“We know it, sir,” said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her ‘brother’s’\\nhand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; “trouble not\\nthyself as to that. \\xa0The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper’s.”\\n\\n“Thou’rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,” said Tom, gratefully, “and my\\nheart moveth me to thank thee for’t, an’ I may be so bold.”\\n\\nOnce the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.\\n\\xa0The Princess Elizabeth’s quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the\\ntarget’s front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered\\na return volley of sounding Greek on Tom’s behalf, and then straightway\\nchanged the talk to other matters.\\n\\nTime wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole. Snags and\\nsandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at\\nhis ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and\\noverlooking his mistakes. \\xa0When it came out that the little ladies were\\nto accompany him to the Lord Mayor’s banquet in the evening, his heart\\ngave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be\\nfriendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an\\nhour earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an\\ninsupportable terror to him.\\n\\nTom’s guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the\\ninterview than the other parties to it. \\xa0They felt much as if they were\\npiloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the\\nalert constantly, and found their office no child’s play. Wherefore,\\nat last, when the ladies’ visit was drawing to a close and the Lord\\nGuilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had\\nbeen sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves\\nwere not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their\\nanxious voyage all over again. \\xa0So they respectfully advised Tom to\\nexcuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade\\nof disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane’s face when\\nshe heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.\\n\\nThere was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not\\nunderstand. \\xa0He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign--but he\\nfailed to understand that also. \\xa0The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue\\nwith her usual easy grace. \\xa0She made reverence and said--\\n\\n“Have we leave of the prince’s grace my brother to go?”\\n\\nTom said--\\n\\n“Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the\\nasking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor\\npower lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence\\nhence. \\xa0Give ye good den, and God be with ye!” Then he smiled inwardly\\nat the thought, “‘Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in\\nmy reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered\\nand gracious speech withal!”\\n\\nWhen the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his\\nkeepers and said--\\n\\n“May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner\\nand rest me?”\\n\\nLord Hertford said--\\n\\n“So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to\\nobey. That thou should’st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou\\nmust journey to the city presently.”\\n\\nHe touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the\\npresence of Sir William Herbert. \\xa0This gentleman came straightway, and\\nconducted Tom to an inner apartment. \\xa0Tom’s first movement there was\\nto reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it,\\ndropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver.\\n\\nNext the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins,\\ntimidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet\\ndiscomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him. \\xa0He\\nmade two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly\\nforestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation\\nand a murmured “Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe\\nfor me also!” \\xa0Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid\\nhimself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too\\nfull of thoughts and the room too full of people. \\xa0He could not dismiss\\nthe former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the\\nlatter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret--and theirs.\\n\\nTom’s departure had left his two noble guardians alone. \\xa0They mused a\\nwhile, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Plainly, what dost thou think?”\\n\\n“Plainly, then, this. \\xa0The King is near his end; my nephew is mad--mad\\nwill mount the throne, and mad remain. \\xa0God protect England, since she\\nwill need it!”\\n\\n“Verily it promiseth so, indeed. \\xa0But . . . have you no misgivings as to\\n. . . as to . . .”\\n\\nThe speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. \\xa0He evidently felt that he\\nwas upon delicate ground. \\xa0Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into\\nhis face with a clear, frank eye, and said--\\n\\n“Speak on--there is none to hear but me. \\xa0Misgivings as to what?”\\n\\n“I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near\\nto him in blood, my lord. \\xa0But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it\\nnot strange that madness could so change his port and manner?--not but\\nthat his port and speech are princely still, but that they _differ_,\\nin one unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime.\\n\\xa0Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his\\nfather’s very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due\\nfrom such as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his\\nGreek and French? \\xa0My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its\\ndisquiet and receive my grateful thanks. \\xa0It haunteth me, his saying he\\nwas not the prince, and so--”\\n\\n“Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason! \\xa0Hast forgot the King’s command?\\nRemember I am party to thy crime if I but listen.”\\n\\nSt. John paled, and hastened to say--\\n\\n“I was in fault, I do confess it. \\xa0Betray me not, grant me this grace\\nout of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing\\nmore. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined.”\\n\\n“I am content, my lord. \\xa0So thou offend not again, here or in the\\nears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken. \\xa0But thou\\nneed’st not have misgivings. \\xa0He is my sister’s son; are not his voice,\\nhis face, his form, familiar to me from his cradle? Madness can do all\\nthe odd conflicting things thou seest in him, and more. \\xa0Dost not recall\\nhow that the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his\\nown countenance that he had known for sixty years, and held it was\\nanother’s; nay, even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that\\nhis head was made of Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none\\nto touch it, lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? \\xa0Give\\nthy misgivings easement, good my lord. \\xa0This is the very prince--I know\\nhim well--and soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this\\nin mind, and more dwell upon it than the other.”\\n\\nAfter some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his\\nmistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was\\nthoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the\\nLord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and\\nward alone. \\xa0He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he\\nthought, the more he was bothered. \\xa0By-and-by he began to pace the floor\\nand mutter.\\n\\n“Tush, he _must_ be the prince! \\xa0Will any be in all the land maintain\\nthere can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?\\n\\xa0And even were it so, ’twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should\\ncast the one into the other’s place. Nay, ’tis folly, folly, folly!”\\n\\nPresently he said--\\n\\n“Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you _that_ would\\nbe natural; that would be reasonable. \\xa0But lived ever an impostor yet,\\nwho, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by\\nall, _denied_ his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation? \\xa0_No_! \\xa0By\\nthe soul of St. Swithin, no! \\xa0This is the true prince, gone mad!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII. Tom’s first royal dinner.\\n\\nSomewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal\\nof being dressed for dinner. \\xa0He found himself as finely clothed as\\nbefore, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to\\nhis stockings. \\xa0He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious\\nand ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one. \\xa0Its\\nfurniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which\\nwell-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. \\xa0The\\nroom was half-filled with noble servitors. \\xa0A chaplain said grace, and\\nTom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with\\nhim, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a\\nnapkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince\\nof Wales was hereditary in this nobleman’s family. \\xa0Tom’s cupbearer was\\npresent, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. \\xa0The\\nTaster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to\\ntaste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being\\npoisoned. \\xa0He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was\\nseldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times,\\nnot many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils,\\nand was not a grandeur to be desired. \\xa0Why they did not use a dog or a\\nplumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange. \\xa0My\\nLord d’Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows\\nwhat; but there he was--let that suffice. \\xa0The Lord Chief Butler was\\nthere, and stood behind Tom’s chair, overseeing the solemnities, under\\ncommand of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood\\nnear. \\xa0Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these;\\nbut they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them;\\nneither was Tom aware yet that they existed.\\n\\nAll those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to\\nremember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be\\ncareful to show no surprise at his vagaries. \\xa0These ‘vagaries’ were\\nsoon on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and\\ntheir sorrow, not their mirth. \\xa0It was a heavy affliction to them to see\\nthe beloved prince so stricken.\\n\\nPoor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even\\nseemed to observe it. \\xa0He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep\\ninterest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said\\nwith simplicity--\\n\\n“Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.”\\n\\nThe Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without\\nword or protest of any sort.\\n\\nTom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what\\nthey were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that\\nmen had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing\\nthem as luxuries from Holland. {1} \\xa0His question was answered with grave\\nrespect, and no surprise manifested. \\xa0When he had finished his dessert,\\nhe filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it,\\nor disturbed by it. \\xa0But the next moment he was himself disturbed by\\nit, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been\\npermitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt\\nthat he had done a most improper and unprincely thing. \\xa0At that moment\\nthe muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to\\nlift and wrinkle. \\xa0This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing\\ndistress. \\xa0He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the\\nlords about him, and tears came into his eyes. \\xa0They sprang forward with\\ndismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble. \\xa0Tom said with\\ngenuine anguish--\\n\\n“I crave your indulgence: \\xa0my nose itcheth cruelly. \\xa0What is the custom\\nand usage in this emergence? \\xa0Prithee, speed, for ’tis but a little time\\nthat I can bear it.”\\n\\nNone smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other\\nin deep tribulation for counsel. \\xa0But behold, here was a dead wall, and\\nnothing in English history to tell how to get over it. \\xa0The Master of\\nCeremonies was not present: \\xa0there was no one who felt safe to venture\\nupon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn\\nproblem. \\xa0Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher. \\xa0Meantime the tears\\nhad overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom’s cheeks. \\xa0His\\ntwitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. \\xa0At last\\nnature broke down the barriers of etiquette: \\xa0Tom lifted up an inward\\nprayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the\\nburdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.\\n\\nHis meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow,\\ngolden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and\\nfingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin\\nfor his use. \\xa0Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised\\nit to his lips, and gravely took a draught. \\xa0Then he returned it to the\\nwaiting lord, and said--\\n\\n“Nay, it likes me not, my lord: \\xa0it hath a pretty flavour, but it\\nwanteth strength.”\\n\\nThis new eccentricity of the prince’s ruined mind made all the hearts\\nabout him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.\\n\\nTom’s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table\\njust when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with\\nuplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning\\nthe blessing. \\xa0Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done\\na thing unusual.\\n\\nBy his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private\\ncabinet, and left there alone to his own devices. \\xa0Hanging upon hooks in\\nthe oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel\\narmour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid\\nin gold. \\xa0This martial panoply belonged to the true prince--a recent\\npresent from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the\\ngauntlets, the plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don\\nwithout assistance, and for a while was minded to call for help and\\ncomplete the matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away\\nfrom dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye\\nhim, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services;\\nso he restored the pretty things to their several places, and soon was\\ncracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time\\nsince God for his sins had made him a prince. \\xa0When the nuts were all\\ngone, he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet, among them one\\nabout the etiquette of the English court. \\xa0This was a prize. He lay down\\nupon a sumptuous divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest\\nzeal. \\xa0Let us leave him there for the present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII. The Question of the Seal.\\n\\nAbout five o’clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and\\nmuttered to himself, “Troublous dreams, troublous dreams! Mine end is\\nnow at hand: \\xa0so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm\\nit.” Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered,\\n“Yet will not I die till _He_ go before.”\\n\\nHis attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his\\npleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.\\n\\n“Admit him, admit him!” exclaimed the King eagerly.\\n\\nThe Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King’s couch, saying--\\n\\n“I have given order, and, according to the King’s command, the peers of\\nthe realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where,\\nhaving confirmed the Duke of Norfolk’s doom, they humbly wait his\\nmajesty’s further pleasure in the matter.”\\n\\nThe King’s face lit up with a fierce joy. \\xa0Said he--\\n\\n“Lift me up! \\xa0In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and\\nwith mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of--”\\n\\nHis voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and\\nthe attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted\\nhim with restoratives. \\xa0Presently he said sorrowfully--\\n\\n“Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it\\ncometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance. \\xa0But speed ye, speed\\nye! let others do this happy office sith ’tis denied to me. I put my\\nGreat Seal in commission: \\xa0choose thou the lords that shall compose it,\\nand get ye to your work. \\xa0Speed ye, man! \\xa0Before the sun shall rise and\\nset again, bring me his head that I may see it.”\\n\\n“According to the King’s command, so shall it be. \\xa0Will’t please your\\nmajesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may\\nforth upon the business?”\\n\\n“The Seal? \\xa0Who keepeth the Seal but thou?”\\n\\n“Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it\\nshould no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon\\nthe Duke of Norfolk’s warrant.”\\n\\n“Why, so in sooth I did: \\xa0I do remember. . . . What did I with it?...\\nI am very feeble. . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the\\ntraitor with me. . . . ’tis strange, strange--”\\n\\nThe King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head\\nweakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he\\nhad done with the Seal. \\xa0At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and\\noffer information--\\n\\n“Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with\\nme how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the\\nPrince of Wales to keep against the day that--”\\n\\n“True, most true!” interrupted the King.  “Fetch it! \\xa0Go: \\xa0time flieth!”\\n\\nLord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long,\\ntroubled and empty-handed. \\xa0He delivered himself to this effect--\\n\\n“It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome\\ntidings; but it is the will of God that the prince’s affliction abideth\\nstill, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal. \\xa0So came\\nI quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and\\nlittle worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of\\nchambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high--”\\n\\nA groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point. \\xa0After a\\nlittle while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone--\\n\\n“Trouble him no more, poor child. \\xa0The hand of God lieth heavy upon him,\\nand my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I\\nmay not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so\\nbring him peace.”\\n\\nHe closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After\\na time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his\\nglance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face\\nflushed with wrath--\\n\\n“What, thou here yet! \\xa0By the glory of God, an’ thou gettest not about\\nthat traitor’s business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for\\nlack of a head to grace withal!”\\n\\nThe trembling Chancellor answered--\\n\\n“Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy! \\xa0I but waited for the Seal.”\\n\\n“Man, hast lost thy wits? \\xa0The small Seal which aforetime I was wont\\nto take with me abroad lieth in my treasury. \\xa0And, since the Great Seal\\nhath flown away, shall not it suffice? \\xa0Hast lost thy wits? \\xa0Begone!\\n\\xa0And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.”\\n\\nThe poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous\\nvicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent\\nto the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the\\nbeheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX. The river pageant.\\n\\nAt nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was\\nblazing with light. \\xa0The river itself, as far as the eye could reach\\ncitywards, was so thickly covered with watermen’s boats and with\\npleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated\\nby the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of\\nflowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds. \\xa0The grand terrace of\\nstone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army\\nof a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks\\nof royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly\\ncostumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of\\npreparation.\\n\\nPresently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures\\nvanished from the steps. \\xa0Now the air was heavy with the hush of\\nsuspense and expectancy. \\xa0As far as one’s vision could carry, he might\\nsee the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes\\nfrom the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace.\\n\\nA file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps. \\xa0They were\\nrichly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.\\nSome of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with\\ncloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with\\nsilken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them,\\nwhich shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes\\nfluttered them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to\\nnobles in the prince’s immediate service, had their sides picturesquely\\nfenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings. \\xa0Each\\nstate barge was towed by a tender. \\xa0Besides the rowers, these tenders\\ncarried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate,\\nand a company of musicians.\\n\\nThe advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great\\ngateway, a troop of halberdiers.  ‘They were dressed in striped hose of\\nblack and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and\\ndoublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back\\nwith the three feathers, the prince’s blazon, woven in gold. \\xa0Their\\nhalberd staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt\\nnails, and ornamented with gold tassels. \\xa0Filing off on the right and\\nleft, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the\\npalace to the water’s edge. \\xa0A thick rayed cloth or carpet was\\nthen unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the\\ngold-and-crimson liveries of the prince. \\xa0This done, a flourish of\\ntrumpets resounded from within. \\xa0A lively prelude arose from the\\nmusicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a\\nslow and stately pace from the portal. \\xa0They were followed by an officer\\nbearing the civic mace, after whom came another carrying the city’s\\nsword; then several sergeants of the city guard, in their full\\naccoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the Garter\\nKing-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with\\na white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in\\ntheir robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of\\nEngland, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever;\\nthen a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the\\nheads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state. Now\\ncame twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of\\npourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of\\ncrimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured\\nhauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps. \\xa0They were of the\\nsuite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of\\nthe suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved\\nby any ornament. \\xa0Following these came several great English nobles with\\ntheir attendants.’\\n\\nThere was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince’s uncle, the\\nfuture great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a\\n‘doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered\\nwith gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.’ \\xa0He turned, doffed\\nhis plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step\\nbackward, bowing at each step. \\xa0A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and\\na proclamation, “Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of\\nWales!” \\xa0High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of\\nflame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river\\nburst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero\\nof it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.\\n\\nHe was ‘magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a\\nfront-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged\\nwith ermine. \\xa0Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced\\nwith the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls\\nand precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants. \\xa0About his\\nneck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;’\\nand wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.\\n\\xa0O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar\\nwith rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X. The Prince in the toils.\\n\\nWe left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with\\na noisy and delighted mob at his heels. \\xa0There was but one person in it\\nwho offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he\\nwas hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil. \\xa0The Prince continued\\nto struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was\\nsuffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him,\\nand raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince’s head.\\n\\xa0The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man’s arm, and the\\nblow descended upon his own wrist. \\xa0Canty roared out--\\n\\n“Thou’lt meddle, wilt thou? \\xa0Then have thy reward.”\\n\\nHis cudgel crashed down upon the meddler’s head: \\xa0there was a groan, a\\ndim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next\\nmoment it lay there in the dark alone. \\xa0The mob pressed on, their\\nenjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.\\n\\nPresently the Prince found himself in John Canty’s abode, with the door\\nclosed against the outsiders. \\xa0By the vague light of a tallow candle\\nwhich was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the\\nloathsome den, and also the occupants of it. \\xa0Two frowsy girls and\\na middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the\\naspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading\\nit now. From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey\\nhair and malignant eyes. \\xa0John Canty said to this one--\\n\\n“Tarry! \\xa0There’s fine mummeries here. \\xa0Mar them not till thou’st enjoyed\\nthem: \\xa0then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt. \\xa0Stand forth, lad. \\xa0Now\\nsay thy foolery again, an thou’st not forgot it. Name thy name. \\xa0Who art\\nthou?”\\n\\nThe insulted blood mounted to the little prince’s cheek once more, and\\nhe lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man’s face and said--\\n\\n“‘Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak. \\xa0I tell\\nthee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none\\nother.”\\n\\nThe stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag’s feet to the floor\\nwhere she stood, and almost took her breath. \\xa0She stared at the Prince\\nin stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst\\ninto a roar of laughter. \\xa0But the effect upon Tom Canty’s mother and\\nsisters was different. \\xa0Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to\\ndistress of a different sort. \\xa0They ran forward with woe and dismay in\\ntheir faces, exclaiming--\\n\\n“Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!”\\n\\nThe mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his\\nshoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.\\nThen she said--\\n\\n“Oh, my poor boy! \\xa0Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at\\nlast, and ta’en thy wit away. \\xa0Ah! why did’st thou cleave to it when I\\nso warned thee ‘gainst it? \\xa0Thou’st broke thy mother’s heart.”\\n\\nThe Prince looked into her face, and said gently--\\n\\n“Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame. \\xa0Comfort thee:\\nlet me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my\\nfather restore him to thee.”\\n\\n“The King thy father! \\xa0Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted\\nwith death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee. \\xa0Shake of\\nthis gruesome dream. \\xa0Call back thy poor wandering memory. \\xa0Look upon\\nme. Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?”\\n\\nThe Prince shook his head and reluctantly said--\\n\\n“God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never\\nlooked upon thy face before.”\\n\\nThe woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her\\neyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.\\n\\n“Let the show go on!” shouted Canty.  “What, Nan!--what, Bet! mannerless\\nwenches! will ye stand in the Prince’s presence? \\xa0Upon your knees, ye\\npauper scum, and do him reverence!”\\n\\nHe followed this with another horse-laugh. \\xa0The girls began to plead\\ntimidly for their brother; and Nan said--\\n\\n“An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his\\nmadness: \\xa0prithee, do.”\\n\\n“Do, father,” said Bet; “he is more worn than is his wont. \\xa0To-morrow\\nwill he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not\\nempty home again.”\\n\\nThis remark sobered the father’s joviality, and brought his mind to\\nbusiness. \\xa0He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said--\\n\\n“The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two\\npennies, mark ye--all this money for a half-year’s rent, else out of\\nthis we go. \\xa0Show what thou’st gathered with thy lazy begging.”\\n\\nThe Prince said--\\n\\n“Offend me not with thy sordid matters. \\xa0I tell thee again I am the\\nKing’s son.”\\n\\nA sounding blow upon the Prince’s shoulder from Canty’s broad palm\\nsent him staggering into goodwife Canty’s arms, who clasped him to her\\nbreast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by\\ninterposing her own person. \\xa0The frightened girls retreated to their\\ncorner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.\\n\\xa0The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming--\\n\\n“Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam. \\xa0Let these swine do their will\\nupon me alone.”\\n\\nThis speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about\\ntheir work without waste of time. \\xa0Between them they belaboured the boy\\nright soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for\\nshowing sympathy for the victim.\\n\\n“Now,” said Canty, “to bed, all of ye. \\xa0The entertainment has tired me.”\\n\\nThe light was put out, and the family retired. \\xa0As soon as the snorings\\nof the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep,\\nthe young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly\\nfrom the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also,\\nand stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of\\ncomfort and compassion in his ear the while. \\xa0She had saved a morsel for\\nhim to eat, also; but the boy’s pains had swept away all appetite--at\\nleast for black and tasteless crusts. \\xa0He was touched by her brave and\\ncostly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in\\nvery noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try\\nto forget her sorrows. \\xa0And he added that the King his father would not\\nlet her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded. \\xa0This return to his\\n‘madness’ broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again\\nand again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.\\n\\nAs she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into\\nher mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was\\nlacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane. \\xa0She could not describe it, she could\\nnot tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to\\ndetect it and perceive it. \\xa0What if the boy were really not her son,\\nafter all? \\xa0Oh, absurd! \\xa0She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her\\ngriefs and troubles. \\xa0No matter, she found that it was an idea that\\nwould not ‘down,’ but persisted in haunting her. \\xa0It pursued her, it\\nharassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.\\n\\xa0At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her\\nuntil she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without\\nquestion, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these\\nwearing and worrying doubts. \\xa0Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way\\nout of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to\\ncontrive that test. \\xa0But it was an easier thing to propose than to\\naccomplish. \\xa0She turned over in her mind one promising test after\\nanother, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were\\nabsolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not\\nsatisfy her. \\xa0Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed\\nmanifest that she must give the matter up. \\xa0While this depressing\\nthought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular\\nbreathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep. \\xa0And while she\\nlistened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled\\ncry, such as one utters in a troubled dream. \\xa0This chance occurrence\\nfurnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests\\ncombined. \\xa0She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work\\nto relight her candle, muttering to herself, “Had I but seen him _then_,\\nI should have known! \\xa0Since that day, when he was little, that the\\npowder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of\\nhis dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his\\neyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the\\npalm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a\\nhundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed. \\xa0Yes, I shall\\nsoon know, now!”\\n\\nBy this time she had crept to the slumbering boy’s side, with the\\ncandle, shaded, in her hand. \\xa0She bent heedfully and warily over him,\\nscarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed\\nthe light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles.\\n\\xa0The sleeper’s eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about\\nhim--but he made no special movement with his hands.\\n\\nThe poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief;\\nbut she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the boy to sleep\\nagain; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon\\nthe disastrous result of her experiment. \\xa0She tried to believe that her\\nTom’s madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could\\nnot do it.  “No,” she said, “his _hands_ are not mad; they could not\\nunlearn so old a habit in so brief a time. \\xa0Oh, this is a heavy day for\\nme!”\\n\\nStill, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not\\nbring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing\\nagain--the failure must have been only an accident; so she startled the\\nboy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals--with the\\nsame result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to\\nbed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, “But I cannot give him up--oh\\nno, I cannot, I cannot--he _must_ be my boy!”\\n\\nThe poor mother’s interruptions having ceased, and the Prince’s pains\\nhaving gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at\\nlast sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep. Hour after hour\\nslipped away, and still he slept like the dead. Thus four or five hours\\npassed. Then his stupor began to lighten. Presently, while half asleep\\nand half awake, he murmured--\\n\\n“Sir William!”\\n\\nAfter a moment--\\n\\n“Ho, Sir William Herbert! \\xa0Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest\\ndream that ever . . . Sir William! dost hear? \\xa0Man, I did think me\\nchanged to a pauper, and . . . Ho there! \\xa0Guards! Sir William! \\xa0What!\\nis there no groom of the chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard\\nwith--”\\n\\n“What aileth thee?” asked a whisper near him.  “Who art thou calling?”\\n\\n“Sir William Herbert. \\xa0Who art thou?”\\n\\n“I? \\xa0Who should I be, but thy sister Nan? \\xa0Oh, Tom, I had forgot!\\nThou’rt mad yet--poor lad, thou’rt mad yet: \\xa0would I had never woke to\\nknow it again! \\xa0But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten\\ntill we die!”\\n\\nThe startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his\\nstiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his\\nfoul straw with a moan and the ejaculation--\\n\\n“Alas! it was no dream, then!”\\n\\nIn a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished\\nwere upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted\\nprince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but\\na pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for\\nbeasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.\\n\\nIn the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises\\nand shoutings, apparently but a block or two away. \\xa0The next moment\\nthere were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from\\nsnoring and said--\\n\\n“Who knocketh? \\xa0What wilt thou?”\\n\\nA voice answered--\\n\\n“Know’st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?”\\n\\n“No. \\xa0Neither know I, nor care.”\\n\\n“Belike thou’lt change thy note eftsoons. \\xa0An thou would save thy neck,\\nnothing but flight may stead thee. \\xa0The man is this moment delivering up\\nthe ghost.  ’Tis the priest, Father Andrew!”\\n\\n“God-a-mercy!” exclaimed Canty. \\xa0He roused his family, and hoarsely\\ncommanded, “Up with ye all and fly--or bide where ye are and perish!”\\n\\nScarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and\\nflying for their lives. \\xa0John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and\\nhurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice--\\n\\n“Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name. \\xa0I will choose\\nme a new name, speedily, to throw the law’s dogs off the scent. \\xa0Mind\\nthy tongue, I tell thee!”\\n\\nHe growled these words to the rest of the family--\\n\\n“If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge;\\nwhoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper’s shop on the\\nbridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee\\ninto Southwark together.”\\n\\nAt this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light;\\nand not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing,\\ndancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.\\nThere was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up\\nand down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge\\nlikewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of\\ncoloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies\\nwith an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain\\nof dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were\\ncrowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large.\\n\\nJohn Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat;\\nbut it was too late. \\xa0He and his tribe were swallowed up in that\\nswarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in\\nan instant. We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe;\\nCanty still kept his grip upon him. \\xa0The Prince’s heart was beating high\\nwith hopes of escape, now. \\xa0A burly waterman, considerably exalted with\\nliquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough\\nthrough the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty’s shoulder and said--\\n\\n“Nay, whither so fast, friend? \\xa0Dost canker thy soul with sordid\\nbusiness when all that be leal men and true make holiday?”\\n\\n“Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not,” answered Canty,\\nroughly; “take away thy hand and let me pass.”\\n\\n“Sith that is thy humour, thou’lt _not_ pass, till thou’st drunk to the\\nPrince of Wales, I tell thee that,” said the waterman, barring the way\\nresolutely.\\n\\n“Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!”\\n\\nOther revellers were interested by this time. \\xa0They cried out--\\n\\n“The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the\\nloving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes.”\\n\\nSo a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of\\nits handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary\\nnapkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp\\nthe opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the\\nother, according to ancient custom. This left the Prince hand-free for\\na second, of course. \\xa0He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of\\nlegs about him and disappeared. \\xa0In another moment he could not have\\nbeen harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had\\nbeen the Atlantic’s and he a lost sixpence.\\n\\nHe very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about\\nhis own affairs without further thought of John Canty. \\xa0He quickly\\nrealised another thing, too. \\xa0To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales\\nwas being feasted by the city in his stead. \\xa0He easily concluded that\\nthe pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his\\nstupendous opportunity and become a usurper.\\n\\nTherefore there was but one course to pursue--find his way to the\\nGuildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor. \\xa0He also made\\nup his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual\\npreparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the\\nlaw and usage of the day in cases of high treason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. At Guildhall.\\n\\nThe royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way\\ndown the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was\\nladen with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the\\ndistant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible\\nbonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted\\nwith sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like\\njewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted\\nfrom the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless\\nflash and boom of artillery.\\n\\nTo Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this\\nspectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his\\nlittle friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane\\nGrey, they were nothing.\\n\\nArrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook\\n(whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under\\nacres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges\\npopulous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to\\na halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient\\ncity of London. \\xa0Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession\\ncrossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and\\nBasinghall Street to the Guildhall.\\n\\nTom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord\\nMayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet\\nrobes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of\\nthe great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace\\nand the City Sword. \\xa0The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom\\nand his two small friends took their places behind their chairs.\\n\\nAt a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree\\nwere seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at\\na multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall. \\xa0From their lofty\\nvantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the\\ncity, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar\\nto it in forgotten generations. \\xa0There was a bugle-blast and a\\nproclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward\\nwall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a\\nroyal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife.\\n\\nAfter grace, Tom (being instructed) rose--and the whole house with\\nhim--and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess\\nElizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the\\ngeneral assemblage. \\xa0So the banquet began.\\n\\nBy midnight the revelry was at its height. \\xa0Now came one of those\\npicturesque spectacles so admired in that old day. \\xa0A description of it\\nis still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:\\n\\n‘Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after\\nthe Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on\\ntheir heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two\\nswords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold. \\xa0Next came\\nyet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,\\ntraversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of\\ncrimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on\\ntheir heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots\\nwith pykes’ (points a foot long), ’turned up. \\xa0And after them came\\na knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in\\ndoublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the\\ncannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over\\nthat, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after\\nthe dancers’ fashion, with pheasants’ feathers in them. \\xa0These were\\nappareled after the fashion of Prussia. \\xa0The torchbearers, which were\\nabout an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors,\\ntheir faces black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which\\nwere disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also,\\nthat it was a pleasure to behold.’\\n\\nAnd while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this ‘wild’ dancing,\\nlost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours\\nwhich the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the\\nragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and\\nhis wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at\\nthe gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously,\\nand pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.\\nPresently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him\\ninto a higher and still more entertaining fury. \\xa0Tears of mortification\\nsprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right\\nroyally. \\xa0Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!\\nAnd all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of\\ngrace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground,\\nbut will maintain it!”\\n\\n“Though thou be prince or no prince, ’tis all one, thou be’st a gallant\\nlad, and not friendless neither! \\xa0Here stand I by thy side to prove\\nit; and mind I tell thee thou might’st have a worser friend than Miles\\nHendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my\\nchild; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very\\nnative.”\\n\\nThe speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and\\nbearing. \\xa0He was tall, trim-built, muscular. \\xa0His doublet and trunks\\nwere of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace\\nadornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged;\\nthe plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and\\ndisreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron\\nsheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of\\nthe camp. \\xa0The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an\\nexplosion of jeers and laughter. \\xa0Some cried, “‘Tis another prince in\\ndisguise!” “‘Ware thy tongue, friend: \\xa0belike he is dangerous!”\\n  “Marry, he looketh it--mark his eye!”  “Pluck the lad from him--to the\\nhorse-pond wi’ the cub!”\\n\\nInstantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this\\nhappy thought; as instantly the stranger’s long sword was out and the\\nmeddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.\\nThe next moment a score of voices shouted, “Kill the dog! \\xa0Kill him!\\nKill him!” and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself\\nagainst a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a\\nmadman. \\xa0His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured\\nover their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with\\nundiminished fury.\\n\\nHis moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a\\ntrumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, “Way for the King’s messenger!”\\n and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of\\nharm’s reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger\\ncaught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and\\nthe multitude.\\n\\nReturn we within the Guildhall. \\xa0Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar\\nand thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note. \\xa0There\\nwas instant silence--a deep hush; then a single voice rose--that of the\\nmessenger from the palace--and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the\\nwhole multitude standing listening.\\n\\nThe closing words, solemnly pronounced, were--\\n\\n“The King is dead!”\\n\\nThe great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one\\naccord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank\\nupon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a\\nmighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building--\\n\\n“Long live the King!”\\n\\nPoor Tom’s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle,\\nand finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a\\nmoment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his\\nface. \\xa0He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford’s ear--\\n\\n“Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour! \\xa0Uttered I here a command,\\nthe which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter,\\nwould such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?”\\n\\n“None, my liege, in all these realms. \\xa0In thy person bides the majesty\\nof England. \\xa0Thou art the king--thy word is law.”\\n\\nTom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation--\\n\\n“Then shall the king’s law be law of mercy, from this day, and never\\nmore be law of blood! \\xa0Up from thy knees and away! \\xa0To the Tower, and\\nsay the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!”\\n\\nThe words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and\\nwide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another\\nprodigious shout burst forth--\\n\\n“The reign of blood is ended! \\xa0Long live Edward, King of England!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII. The Prince and his Deliverer.\\n\\nAs soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob,\\nthey struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river. \\xa0Their\\nway was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they\\nploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon\\nthe Prince’s--no, the King’s--wrist. \\xa0The tremendous news was already\\nabroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once--“The King\\nis dead!” \\xa0The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little\\nwaif, and sent a shudder through his frame. \\xa0He realised the greatness\\nof his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who\\nhad been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him. \\xa0The\\ntears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects. \\xa0For an instant\\nhe felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God’s\\ncreatures--then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching\\nthunders:  “Long live King Edward the Sixth!” and this made his eyes\\nkindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers’ ends. “Ah,” he\\nthought, “how grand and strange it seems--_I am King_!”\\n\\nOur friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the\\nbridge. \\xa0This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and\\nhad been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious\\naffair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family\\nquarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of\\nthe river to the other. \\xa0The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it\\nhad its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food\\nmarkets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church. \\xa0It\\nlooked upon the two neighbours which it linked together--London\\nand Southwark--as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise\\nparticularly important. \\xa0It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was\\na narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its\\npopulation was but a village population and everybody in it knew all\\nhis fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers\\nbefore them--and all their little family affairs into the bargain. \\xa0It\\nhad its aristocracy, of course--its fine old families of butchers, and\\nbakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five\\nor six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from\\nbeginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked\\nbridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level,\\ndirect, substantial bridgy way. \\xa0It was just the sort of population to\\nbe narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the\\nBridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without\\never having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge\\nalone. \\xa0Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and\\ninterminable procession which moved through its street night and day,\\nwith its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing\\nand bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in\\nthis world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it. \\xa0And so they\\nwere, in effect--at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and\\ndid--for a consideration--whenever a returning king or hero gave it a\\nfleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long,\\nstraight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.\\n\\nMen born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and\\ninane elsewhere. \\xa0History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at\\nthe age of seventy-one and retired to the country. \\xa0But he could only\\nfret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness\\nwas so painful, so awful, so oppressive. \\xa0When he was worn out with it,\\nat last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and\\nfell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of\\nthe lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge.\\n\\nIn the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished ‘object\\nlessons’ in English history for its children--namely, the livid and\\ndecaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its\\ngateways. \\xa0But we digress.\\n\\nHendon’s lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge. \\xa0As he neared\\nthe door with his small friend, a rough voice said--\\n\\n“So, thou’rt come at last! \\xa0Thou’lt not escape again, I warrant thee;\\nand if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou’lt\\nnot keep us waiting another time, mayhap,”--and John Canty put out his\\nhand to seize the boy.\\n\\nMiles Hendon stepped in the way and said--\\n\\n“Not too fast, friend. \\xa0Thou art needlessly rough, methinks. \\xa0What is\\nthe lad to thee?”\\n\\n“If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others’ affairs,\\nhe is my son.”\\n\\n“‘Tis a lie!” cried the little King, hotly.\\n\\n“Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound\\nor cracked, my boy. \\xa0But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father\\nor no, ’tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse,\\naccording to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me.”\\n\\n“I do, I do--I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go\\nwith him.”\\n\\n“Then ’tis settled, and there is nought more to say.”\\n\\n“We will see, as to that!” exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to\\nget at the boy; “by force shall he--”\\n\\n“If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee like a\\ngoose!” said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword\\nhilt. \\xa0Canty drew back.  “Now mark ye,” continued Hendon, “I took this\\nlad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled\\nhim, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser\\nfate?--for whether thou art his father or no--and sooth to say, I think\\nit is a lie--a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life\\nin such brute hands as thine. \\xa0So go thy ways, and set quick about it,\\nfor I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my\\nnature.”\\n\\nJohn Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed\\nfrom sight in the crowd. \\xa0Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his\\nroom, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither. \\xa0It\\nwas a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old\\nfurniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles.\\nThe little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost\\nexhausted with hunger and fatigue. \\xa0He had been on his feet a good\\npart of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o’clock in the\\nmorning), and had eaten nothing meantime. \\xa0He murmured drowsily--\\n\\n“Prithee call me when the table is spread,” and sank into a deep sleep\\nimmediately.\\n\\nA smile twinkled in Hendon’s eye, and he said to himself--\\n\\n“By the mass, the little beggar takes to one’s quarters and usurps one’s\\nbed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them--with never\\na by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort. \\xa0In his\\ndiseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth\\nhe keep up the character. \\xa0Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his\\nmind has been disordered with ill-usage. \\xa0Well, I will be his friend;\\nI have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the\\nbold-tongued little rascal. \\xa0How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble\\nand flung back his high defiance! \\xa0And what a comely, sweet and gentle\\nface he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its\\ngriefs. I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his\\nelder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would\\nshame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for\\nit he shall need it!”\\n\\nHe bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying\\ninterest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the\\ntangled curls with his great brown hand. \\xa0A slight shiver passed over\\nthe boy’s form. Hendon muttered--\\n\\n“See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill\\nhis body with deadly rheums. \\xa0Now what shall I do? ’twill wake him to\\ntake him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep.”\\n\\nHe looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet\\nand wrapped the lad in it, saying, “I am used to nipping air and scant\\napparel, ’tis little I shall mind the cold!”--then walked up and down\\nthe room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before.\\n\\n“His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; ’twill be odd to\\nhave a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that _was_ the prince\\nis prince no more, but king--for this poor mind is set upon the one\\nfantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince\\nand call itself the king. . . If my father liveth still, after these\\nseven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he\\nwill welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so\\nwill my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh--but I will\\ncrack his crown an _he_ interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned\\nanimal! Yes, thither will we fare--and straightway, too.”\\n\\nA servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal\\ntable, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap\\nlodgers as these to wait upon themselves. \\xa0The door slammed after him,\\nand the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot\\na glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he\\nmurmured to himself, with a deep sigh, “Alack, it was but a dream, woe\\nis me!” \\xa0Next he noticed Miles Hendon’s doublet--glanced from that to\\nHendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said,\\ngently--\\n\\n“Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me. \\xa0Take it and put it\\non--I shall not need it more.”\\n\\nThen he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood\\nthere, waiting. \\xa0Hendon said in a cheery voice--\\n\\n“We’ll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury\\nand smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little\\nman again, never fear!”\\n\\nThe boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with\\ngrave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall\\nknight of the sword. \\xa0Hendon was puzzled, and said--\\n\\n“What’s amiss?”\\n\\n“Good sir, I would wash me.”\\n\\n“Oh, is that all? \\xa0Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou\\ncravest. \\xa0Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that\\nare his belongings.”\\n\\nStill the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or\\ntwice with his small impatient foot. \\xa0Hendon was wholly perplexed. \\xa0Said\\nhe--\\n\\n“Bless us, what is it?”\\n\\n“Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!”\\n\\nHendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, “By all the\\nsaints, but this is admirable!” stepped briskly forward and did the\\nsmall insolent’s bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction,\\nuntil the command, “Come--the towel!” woke him sharply up. \\xa0He took up a\\ntowel, from under the boy’s nose, and handed it to him without comment.\\n\\xa0He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was\\nat it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall\\nto. Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the\\nother chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,\\nindignantly--\\n\\n“Forbear! \\xa0Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?”\\n\\nThis blow staggered Hendon to his foundations. \\xa0He muttered to himself,\\n“Lo, the poor thing’s madness is up with the time! \\xa0It hath changed\\nwith the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is\\nhe _king_! Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too--there is no other\\nway--faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!”\\n\\nAnd pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,\\ntook his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the\\ncourtliest way he was capable of.\\n\\nWhile the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little,\\nand with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said--“I\\nthink thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?”\\n\\n“Yes, Sire,” Miles replied; then observed to himself, “If I _must_\\nhumour the poor lad’s madness, I must ‘Sire’ him, I must ‘Majesty’ him,\\nI must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the\\npart I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable\\nand kindly cause.”\\n\\nThe King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said--“I\\nwould know thee--tell me thy story. \\xa0Thou hast a gallant way with thee,\\nand a noble--art nobly born?”\\n\\n“We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty. \\xa0My father is\\na baronet--one of the smaller lords by knight service {2}--Sir Richard\\nHendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk’s Holm in Kent.”\\n\\n“The name has escaped my memory. \\xa0Go on--tell me thy story.”\\n\\n“‘Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short\\nhalf-hour for want of a better. \\xa0My father, Sir Richard, is very rich,\\nand of a most generous nature. \\xa0My mother died whilst I was yet a\\nboy. \\xa0I have two brothers: \\xa0Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to\\nhis father’s; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous,\\ntreacherous, vicious, underhanded--a reptile. \\xa0Such was he from the\\ncradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him--a ripe rascal\\nat nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two. \\xa0There is\\nnone other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin--she was sixteen\\nthen--beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her\\nrace, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title. \\xa0My father was her\\nguardian. \\xa0I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur\\nfrom the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be\\nbroken. \\xa0Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and\\nhold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give\\nsuccess to our several causes. \\xa0Hugh loved the Lady Edith’s fortune,\\nthough in truth he said it was herself he loved--but then ’twas his way,\\nalway, to say the one thing and mean the other. \\xa0But he lost his arts\\nupon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else. \\xa0My father\\nloved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the\\nyoungest child, and others hated him--these qualities being in all\\nages sufficient to win a parent’s dearest love; and he had a smooth\\npersuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying--and these be\\nqualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself.\\n\\xa0I was wild--in troth I might go yet farther and say _very_ wild, though\\n‘twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought\\nshame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness,\\nor what might not beseem mine honourable degree.\\n\\n“Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account--he seeing\\nthat our brother Arthur’s health was but indifferent, and hoping the\\nworst might work him profit were I swept out of the path--so--but ’twere\\na long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling. \\xa0Briefly,\\nthen, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them\\ncrimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine\\napartments--conveyed thither by his own means--and did convince my\\nfather by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying\\nknaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in\\nrank defiance of his will.\\n\\n“Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier\\nand a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom.\\n\\xa0I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting\\nsumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last\\nbattle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed\\nand waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me. \\xa0Through wit\\nand courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and\\nam but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still\\nin knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall,\\nits people and belongings. \\xa0So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told.”\\n\\n“Thou hast been shamefully abused!” said the little King, with a\\nflashing eye.  “But I will right thee--by the cross will I! \\xa0The King\\nhath said it.”\\n\\nThen, fired by the story of Miles’s wrongs, he loosed his tongue and\\npoured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his\\nastonished listener. \\xa0When he had finished, Miles said to himself--\\n\\n“Lo, what an imagination he hath! \\xa0Verily, this is no common mind; else,\\ncrazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this\\nout of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt.\\nPoor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I\\nbide with the living. \\xa0He shall never leave my side; he shall be my\\npet, my little comrade. \\xa0And he shall be cured!--ay, made whole and\\nsound--then will he make himself a name--and proud shall I be to say,\\n‘Yes, he is mine--I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw\\nwhat was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day--behold\\nhim, observe him--was I right?’”\\n\\nThe King spoke--in a thoughtful, measured voice--\\n\\n“Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my\\ncrown. Such service demandeth rich reward. \\xa0Name thy desire, and so it\\nbe within the compass of my royal power, it is thine.”\\n\\nThis fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie. \\xa0He was\\nabout to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only\\ndone his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his\\nhead, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the\\ngracious offer--an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that\\nit was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import.\\n\\nMiles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, “Yes, that is\\nthe thing to do--by any other means it were impossible to get at it--and\\ncertes, this hour’s experience has taught me ’twould be most wearing and\\ninconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I will propose it; ’twas a\\nhappy accident that I did not throw the chance away.” \\xa0Then he dropped\\nupon one knee and said--\\n\\n“My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject’s simple duty,\\nand therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold\\nit worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this\\neffect. \\xa0Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being\\nill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was\\ndecreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so\\nsettle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God. \\xa0These two\\nkings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the\\nconflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he, that\\nour English knights refused to measure weapons with him. \\xa0So the matter,\\nwhich was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by\\ndefault. \\xa0Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in\\nEngland, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with\\nlong captivity. \\xa0Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth\\narrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge\\nframe and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king’s\\ncause was lost. \\xa0King John restored De Courcy’s titles and possessions,\\nand said, ‘Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half\\nmy kingdom;’ whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer,\\n‘This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and\\nhold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of\\nEngland, henceforth while the throne shall last.’ The boon was granted,\\nas your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred\\nyears, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day,\\nthe head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the\\nKing’s Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do.\\n{3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to\\ngrant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient\\nreward--and none other, to wit: \\xa0that I and my heirs, for ever, may\\n_sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England!”\\n\\n“Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,” said the King, gravely--giving the\\naccolade with Hendon’s sword--“rise, and seat thyself. \\xa0Thy petition is\\ngranted. \\xa0Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege\\nshall not lapse.”\\n\\nHis Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at\\ntable, observing to himself, “‘Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought\\nme a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not\\nthought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad’s\\nwits are cured.” \\xa0After a little, he went on, “And so I am become a\\nknight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange\\nposition, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I. \\xa0I will not laugh--no,\\nGod forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is _real_ to\\nhim. \\xa0And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects\\nwith truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.” \\xa0After\\na pause: “Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before\\nfolk!--there’d be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment! \\xa0But\\nno matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be\\ncontent.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.\\n\\nA heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades. \\xa0The King\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Remove these rags.”--meaning his clothing.\\n\\nHendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in\\nbed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, “He hath\\ntaken my bed again, as before--marry, what shall _I_ do?” \\xa0The little\\nKing observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word. \\xa0He said,\\nsleepily--\\n\\n“Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.” \\xa0In a moment more he\\nwas out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.\\n\\n“Dear heart, he should have been born a king!” muttered Hendon,\\nadmiringly; “he playeth the part to a marvel.”\\n\\nThen he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying\\ncontentedly--\\n\\n“I have lodged worse for seven years; ’twould be but ill gratitude to\\nHim above to find fault with this.”\\n\\nHe dropped asleep as the dawn appeared. \\xa0Toward noon he rose, uncovered\\nhis unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took his measure with a\\nstring. \\xa0The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained\\nof the cold, and asked what he was doing.\\n\\n“‘Tis done, now, my liege,” said Hendon; “I have a bit of business\\noutside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needest it.\\nThere--let me cover thy head also--thou’lt be warm the sooner.”\\n\\nThe King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles\\nslipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of\\nthirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy’s\\nclothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and\\nsuited to the season of the year. \\xa0He seated himself, and began to\\noverhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--\\n\\n“A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the\\nlong purse one must be content with what a short one may do--\\n\\n“‘There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell--’\\n\\n“He stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; ’tis not\\ngood to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied\\nout, poor chap . . . This garment--‘tis well enough--a stitch here and\\nanother one there will set it aright. \\xa0This other is better, albeit a\\nstitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . _These_ be very\\ngood and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry--an odd new\\nthing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare,\\nwinters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one\\ngetteth a year’s sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle\\nwithout cost, for mere love. \\xa0Now shall I have the demon’s own time to\\nthread it!”\\n\\nAnd so he had. \\xa0He did as men have always done, and probably always will\\ndo, to the end of time--held the needle still, and tried to thrust the\\nthread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman’s way. \\xa0Time\\nand time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side\\nof the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the\\nshaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before,\\nwhen he was soldiering. \\xa0He succeeded at last, and took up the garment\\nthat had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.\\n\\n“The inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--and there is\\nwherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs\\nfor the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at\\nHendon Hall--\\n\\n“‘She loved her hus--’\\n\\n“Body o’ me! \\xa0I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters\\nlittle--‘tis not a novelty--yet ’tis not a convenience, neither. . . .\\nWe shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will\\nvanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--\\n\\n“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man--’\\n\\n“These be noble large stitches!”--holding the garment up and viewing\\nit admiringly--“they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause\\nthese small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and\\nplebeian--\\n\\n“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,--’\\n\\n“Marry, ’tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with\\nexpedition. \\xa0Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him,\\nand then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark\\nand--be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my\\nliege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith\\nhis slumber is deaf to speech. \\xa0What!”\\n\\nHe threw back the covers--the boy was gone!\\n\\nHe stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for\\nthe first time that his ward’s ragged raiment was also missing; then he\\nbegan to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper. \\xa0At that moment a\\nservant entered with the breakfast.\\n\\n“Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!” roared the man of\\nwar, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter\\ncould not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.\\n “Where is the boy?”\\n\\nIn disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information\\ndesired.\\n\\n“You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came\\nrunning and said it was your worship’s will that the boy come to you\\nstraight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side. \\xa0I brought him\\nhither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did\\ngrumble some little for being disturbed ‘so early,’ as he called it, but\\nstraightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying\\nit had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a\\nstranger--and so--”\\n\\n“And so thou’rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thy breed!\\nYet mayhap no hurt is done. \\xa0Possibly no harm is meant the boy. \\xa0I will\\ngo fetch him. \\xa0Make the table ready. \\xa0Stay! the coverings of the bed\\nwere disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?”\\n\\n“I know not, good your worship. \\xa0I saw the youth meddle with them--he\\nthat came for the boy.”\\n\\n“Thousand deaths!  ‘Twas done to deceive me--‘tis plain ’twas done to\\ngain time. \\xa0Hark ye! \\xa0Was that youth alone?”\\n\\n“All alone, your worship.”\\n\\n“Art sure?”\\n\\n“Sure, your worship.”\\n\\n“Collect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man.”\\n\\nAfter a moment’s thought, the servant said--\\n\\n“When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two\\nstepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out\\nfrom some near place; and just as he was joining them--”\\n\\n“What _then_?--out with it!” thundered the impatient Hendon,\\ninterrupting.\\n\\n“Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no\\nmore, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that\\nthe scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to\\nwitness that to blame _me_ for that miscarriage were like holding the\\nunborn babe to judgment for sins com--”\\n\\n“Out of my sight, idiot! \\xa0Thy prating drives me mad! \\xa0Hold! Whither art\\nflying? \\xa0Canst not bide still an instant? \\xa0Went they toward Southwark?”\\n\\n“Even so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to that detestable\\njoint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--”\\n\\n“Art here _yet_! \\xa0And prating still! \\xa0Vanish, lest I throttle thee!” The\\nservitor vanished. \\xa0Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged\\ndown the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, “‘Tis that scurvy\\nvillain that claimed he was his son. \\xa0I have lost thee, my poor little\\nmad master--it is a bitter thought--and I had come to love thee so! \\xa0No!\\nby book and bell, _not_ lost! \\xa0Not lost, for I will ransack the land\\ntill I find thee again. \\xa0Poor child, yonder is his breakfast--and mine,\\nbut I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it--speed, speed! that\\nis the word!” \\xa0As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes\\nupon the Bridge he several times said to himself--clinging to the\\nthought as if it were a particularly pleasing one--“He grumbled, but he\\n_went_--he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet\\nlad--he would ne’er have done it for another, I know it well.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV. ‘Le Roi est mort--vive le Roi.’\\n\\nToward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy\\nsleep and opened his eyes in the dark. \\xa0He lay silent a few moments,\\ntrying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some\\nsort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous\\nbut guarded voice--\\n\\n“I see it all, I see it all! \\xa0Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at\\nlast! \\xa0Come, joy! vanish, sorrow! \\xa0Ho, Nan! Bet! kick off your straw and\\nhie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the\\nwildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to\\nastonish the soul of man withal! . . . Ho, Nan, I say! \\xa0Bet!”\\n\\nA dim form appeared at his side, and a voice said--\\n\\n“Wilt deign to deliver thy commands?”\\n\\n“Commands? . . . O, woe is me, I know thy voice! \\xa0Speak thou--who am I?”\\n\\n“Thou? \\xa0In sooth, yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales; to-day art\\nthou my most gracious liege, Edward, King of England.”\\n\\nTom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring plaintively--\\n\\n“Alack, it was no dream! \\xa0Go to thy rest, sweet sir--leave me to my\\nsorrows.”\\n\\nTom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream. \\xa0He\\nthought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in the fair meadow\\ncalled Goodman’s Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, with long red\\nwhiskers and a humped back, appeared to him suddenly and said, “Dig by\\nthat stump.” \\xa0He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies--wonderful\\nriches! \\xa0Yet this was not the best of it; for the dwarf said--\\n\\n“I know thee. \\xa0Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy distresses\\nshall end, for the day of thy reward is come. \\xa0Dig here every seventh\\nday, and thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve bright new\\npennies. Tell none--keep the secret.”\\n\\nThen the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize,\\nsaying to himself, “Every night will I give my father a penny; he\\nwill think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more\\nbe beaten. One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall\\nhave; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four. We be done with hunger and\\nrags, now, done with fears and frets and savage usage.”\\n\\nIn his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but with\\neyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his\\nmother’s lap and cried out--\\n\\n“They are for thee!--all of them, every one!--for thee and Nan and\\nBet--and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!”\\n\\nThe happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“It waxeth late--may it please your Majesty to rise?”\\n\\nAh! that was not the answer he was expecting. \\xa0The dream had snapped\\nasunder--he was awake.\\n\\nHe opened his eyes--the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was\\nkneeling by his couch. \\xa0The gladness of the lying dream faded away--the\\npoor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king. \\xa0The room\\nwas filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles--the mourning\\ncolour--and with noble servants of the monarch. \\xa0Tom sat up in bed and\\ngazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.\\n\\nThe weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another\\nknelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences\\nupon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded. \\xa0In the beginning, a\\nshirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the\\nFirst Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of\\nthe Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest,\\nwho passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the\\nChancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master\\nof the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to\\nthe Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the\\nHousehold, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it\\nto the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of\\nCanterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took\\nwhat was left of it and put it on Tom. \\xa0Poor little wondering chap, it\\nreminded him of passing buckets at a fire.\\n\\nEach garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process;\\nconsequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt\\nan almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose\\nbegin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter\\nwas drawing near. \\xa0But he exulted too soon. \\xa0The First Lord of the\\nBedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom’s legs in them,\\nwhen a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things\\nback into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded\\nlook and a whispered, “See, my lord!” pointing to a something connected\\nwith the hose. \\xa0The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the\\nhose to the Lord High Admiral, whispering, “See, my lord!” \\xa0The Admiral\\npassed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had hardly breath\\nenough in his body to ejaculate, “See, my lord!” \\xa0The hose drifted\\nbackward along the line, to the Chief Steward of the Household, the\\nConstable of the Tower, Norroy King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe,\\nthe Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the\\nStole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the\\nBedchamber, the First Lord of the Buckhounds,--accompanied always with\\nthat amazed and frightened “See! see!”--till they finally reached the\\nhands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid\\nface, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely whispered,\\n“Body of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!--to the Tower with\\nthe Head Keeper of the King’s Hose!”--after which he leaned upon the\\nshoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished\\nstrength whilst fresh hose, without any damaged strings to them, were\\nbrought.\\n\\nBut all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in a\\ncondition to get out of bed. \\xa0The proper official poured water, the\\nproper official engineered the washing, the proper official stood by\\nwith a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage\\nand was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal. \\xa0When he at\\nlength emerged from this master’s hands, he was a gracious figure and\\nas pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and\\npurple-plumed cap. \\xa0He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room,\\nthrough the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these\\nfell back, leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees.\\n\\nAfter breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended by his\\ngreat officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt\\nbattle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to transact business\\nof state. \\xa0His ‘uncle,’ Lord Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to\\nassist the royal mind with wise counsel.\\n\\nThe body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors\\nappeared, to ask Tom’s approval of certain acts of theirs--rather a\\nform, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector as yet.\\n\\xa0The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council\\nof Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious\\nMajesty, and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors, to\\nwit: \\xa0the Archbishop of Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England;\\nWilliam Lord St. John; John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John\\nViscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham--\\n\\nTom was not listening--an earlier clause of the document was puzzling\\nhim. \\xa0At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford--\\n\\n“What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?”\\n\\n“The sixteenth of the coming month, my liege.”\\n\\n“‘Tis a strange folly. \\xa0Will he keep?”\\n\\nPoor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was used to\\nseeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a\\nvery different sort of expedition. \\xa0However, the Lord Hertford set his\\nmind at rest with a word or two.\\n\\nA secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the\\nmorrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and\\ndesired the King’s assent.\\n\\nTom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered--\\n\\n“Your Majesty will signify consent. \\xa0They come to testify their royal\\nmasters’ sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and\\nthe realm of England.”\\n\\nTom did as he was bidden. \\xa0Another secretary began to read a preamble\\nconcerning the expenses of the late King’s household, which had amounted\\nto 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months--a sum so vast that it\\nmade Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000\\npounds of this money was still owing and unpaid; {4} and once more when\\nit appeared that the King’s coffers were about empty, and his twelve\\nhundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them. \\xa0Tom\\nspoke out, with lively apprehension--\\n\\n“We be going to the dogs, ’tis plain.  ‘Tis meet and necessary that we\\ntake a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no\\nvalue but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the\\nspirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath\\nnor brains nor hands to help itself withal. \\xa0I remember me of a small\\nhouse that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate--”\\n\\nA sharp pressure upon Tom’s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a\\nblush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this\\nstrange speech had been remarked or given concern.\\n\\nA secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in\\nhis will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and\\nraising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the peerage, and likewise\\nHertford’s son to an earldom, together with similar aggrandisements to\\nother great servants of the Crown, the Council had resolved to hold a\\nsitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of\\nthese honours, and that meantime, the late King not having granted,\\nin writing, estates suitable to the support of these dignities, the\\nCouncil, knowing his private wishes in that regard, had thought proper\\nto grant to Seymour ‘500 pound lands,’ and to Hertford’s son ‘800\\npound lands, and 300 pound of the next bishop’s lands which should fall\\nvacant,’--his present Majesty being willing. {5}\\n\\nTom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the\\nlate King’s debts first, before squandering all this money, but a\\ntimely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful Hertford, saved him\\nthis indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal assent, without spoken\\ncomment, but with much inward discomfort. \\xa0While he sat reflecting a\\nmoment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering\\nmiracles, a happy thought shot into his mind: \\xa0why not make his mother\\nDuchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate? \\xa0But a sorrowful\\nthought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave\\nveterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only\\nthe creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project\\nwith unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor.\\n\\nThe dull work went tediously on. \\xa0Petitions were read, and\\nproclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and\\nwearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed\\npathetically and murmured to himself, “In what have I offended, that the\\ngood God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the\\nsunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?”\\n \\xa0Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his\\nshoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want\\nof that august factor, the ratifying power. \\xa0Silence ensued around\\nthe slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their\\ndeliberations.\\n\\nDuring the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his\\nkeepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little\\nLady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued\\nby the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the\\nend of the visit his ‘elder sister’--afterwards the ‘Bloody Mary’ of\\nhistory--chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in\\nhis eyes, its brevity. \\xa0He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim\\nlad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose\\nclothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of\\nblack,--doublet, hose, and all. \\xa0He bore no badge of mourning but a knot\\nof purple ribbon on his shoulder. \\xa0He advanced hesitatingly, with head\\nbowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom sat still\\nand contemplated him soberly a moment. \\xa0Then he said--\\n\\n“Rise, lad. \\xa0Who art thou. \\xa0What wouldst have?”\\n\\nThe boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern\\nin his face. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord. \\xa0I am thy whipping-boy.”\\n\\n“My _whipping_-boy?”\\n\\n“The same, your Grace. \\xa0I am Humphrey--Humphrey Marlow.”\\n\\nTom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have\\nposted him about. \\xa0The situation was delicate. \\xa0What should he\\ndo?--pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his every utterance\\nthat he had never heard of him before? \\xa0No, that would not do. \\xa0An idea\\ncame to his relief: accidents like this might be likely to happen with\\nsome frequency, now that business urgencies would often call Hertford\\nand St. John from his side, they being members of the Council of\\nExecutors; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan\\nhimself to meet the requirements of such emergencies. \\xa0Yes, that would\\nbe a wise course--he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of\\nsuccess he might achieve. \\xa0So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment\\nor two, and presently said--\\n\\n“Now I seem to remember thee somewhat--but my wit is clogged and dim\\nwith suffering--”\\n\\n“Alack, my poor master!” ejaculated the whipping-boy, with feeling;\\nadding, to himself, “In truth ’tis as they said--his mind is gone--alas,\\npoor soul! \\xa0But misfortune catch me, how am I forgetting! \\xa0They said one\\nmust not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him.”\\n\\n“‘Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,” said Tom.\\n“But mind it not--I mend apace--a little clue doth often serve to bring\\nme back again the things and names which had escaped me. \\xa0(And not they,\\nonly, forsooth, but e’en such as I ne’er heard before--as this lad shall\\nsee.) \\xa0Give thy business speech.”\\n\\n“‘Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon it, an’ it\\nplease your Grace. \\xa0Two days gone by, when your Majesty faulted thrice\\nin your Greek--in the morning lessons,--dost remember it?”\\n\\n“Y-e-s--methinks I do. \\xa0(It is not much of a lie--an’ I had meddled with\\nthe Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but forty times.)\\nYes, I do recall it, now--go on.”\\n\\n“The master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish\\nwork, did promise that he would soundly whip me for it--and--”\\n\\n“Whip _thee_!” said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind. “Why\\nshould he whip _thee_ for faults of mine?”\\n\\n“Ah, your Grace forgetteth again. \\xa0He always scourgeth me when thou dost\\nfail in thy lessons.”\\n\\n“True, true--I had forgot. \\xa0Thou teachest me in private--then if I fail,\\nhe argueth that thy office was lamely done, and--”\\n\\n“Oh, my liege, what words are these? \\xa0I, the humblest of thy servants,\\npresume to teach _thee_?”\\n\\n“Then where is thy blame? \\xa0What riddle is this? \\xa0Am I in truth gone mad,\\nor is it thou? \\xa0Explain--speak out.”\\n\\n“But, good your Majesty, there’s nought that needeth simplifying.--None\\nmay visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows;\\nwherefore, when he faulteth, ’tis I that take them; and meet it is and\\nright, for that it is mine office and my livelihood.” {1}\\n\\nTom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, “Lo, it is a\\nwonderful thing,--a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have\\nnot hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me--would\\nheaven they would!--an’ they will do this thing, I will take my lashings\\nin mine own person, giving God thanks for the change.” Then he said\\naloud--\\n\\n“And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the promise?”\\n\\n“No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and\\nperadventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning\\nthat is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither\\nand remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my\\nbehalf--”\\n\\n“With the master? \\xa0To save thee thy whipping?”\\n\\n“Ah, thou dost remember!”\\n\\n“My memory mendeth, thou seest. \\xa0Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go\\nunscathed--I will see to it.”\\n\\n“Oh, thanks, my good lord!” cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again.\\n“Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--”\\n\\nSeeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he\\nwas “in the granting mood.”\\n\\n“Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart. \\xa0Sith thou art\\nno more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt,\\nwith none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt\\nlonger vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and\\nturn thy mind to things less irksome. Then am I ruined, and mine orphan\\nsisters with me!”\\n\\n“Ruined? \\xa0Prithee how?”\\n\\n“My back is my bread, O my gracious liege! if it go idle, I starve. \\xa0An’\\nthou cease from study mine office is gone thou’lt need no whipping-boy.\\nDo not turn me away!”\\n\\nTom was touched with this pathetic distress. \\xa0He said, with a right\\nroyal burst of generosity--\\n\\n“Discomfort thyself no further, lad. \\xa0Thine office shall be permanent in\\nthee and thy line for ever.” \\xa0Then he struck the boy a light blow on the\\nshoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, “Rise, Humphrey Marlow,\\nHereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England! \\xa0Banish\\nsorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they\\nmust in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine\\noffice be augmented.”\\n\\nThe grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--\\n\\n“Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass\\nmy most distempered dreams of fortune. \\xa0Now shall I be happy all my\\ndays, and all the house of Marlow after me.”\\n\\nTom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful\\nto him. \\xa0He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath.\\n\\xa0He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom’s ‘cure’; for\\nalways, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom’s diseased mind\\nthe various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal\\nschool-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then\\nable to ‘recall’ the circumstances quite clearly. \\xa0At the end of an\\nhour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information\\nconcerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he\\nresolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he\\nwould give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might\\ncome, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people.\\n\\xa0Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with\\nmore trouble for Tom.\\n\\nHe said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought\\nreport of the King’s damaged health might have leaked out and got\\nabroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to\\ndine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous\\nstep, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and\\ngrace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case\\nany evil rumours _had_ gone about--than any other scheme that could be\\ndevised.\\n\\nThen the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the\\nobservances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin\\ndisguise of ‘reminding’ him concerning things already known to him; but\\nto his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help\\nin this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for\\nHumphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine\\nin public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court.\\nTom kept these facts to himself, however.\\n\\nSeeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a\\nfew tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its\\namendment had progressed. \\xa0The results were happy, here and there, in\\nspots--spots where Humphrey’s tracks remained--and on the whole my lord\\nwas greatly pleased and encouraged. \\xa0So encouraged was he, indeed, that\\nhe spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--\\n\\n“Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet\\na little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss\\nwhich was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term\\nof service ended with our late lord’s life. May it please your Grace to\\nmake the trial?”\\n\\nTom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally\\nunacquainted with. \\xa0After a moment’s hesitation he looked up innocently\\nand asked--\\n\\n“What was it like, my lord?”\\n\\nThe Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, “Alack,\\nhis wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain\\nthem”--then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose\\nof sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom’s thoughts--a purpose which\\neasily succeeded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV. Tom as King.\\n\\nThe next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains;\\nand Tom, throned in awful state, received them. \\xa0The splendours of the\\nscene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but\\nthe audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the\\naddresses--wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and\\nhome-sickness by-and-by. \\xa0Tom said the words which Hertford put into\\nhis mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself\\nsatisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease\\nto accomplish more than a tolerable success. \\xa0He looked sufficiently\\nlike a king, but he was ill able to feel like one. \\xa0He was cordially\\nglad when the ceremony was ended.\\n\\nThe larger part of his day was ‘wasted’--as he termed it, in his own\\nmind--in labours pertaining to his royal office. \\xa0Even the two hours\\ndevoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a\\nburden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions\\nand ceremonious observances. \\xa0However, he had a private hour with\\nhis whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both\\nentertainment and needful information out of it.\\n\\nThe third day of Tom Canty’s kingship came and went much as the others\\nhad done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt\\nless uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his\\ncircumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the\\ntime; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and\\nembarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over\\nhis head.\\n\\nBut for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach\\nwithout serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that\\nday. There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day\\nhe would have to preside at a council which would take his views and\\ncommands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign\\nnations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too,\\nHertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector;\\nother things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to\\nTom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all\\nby himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a\\nmultitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon\\nhis mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any.\\n\\nStill, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came. \\xa0It found\\npoor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he\\ncould not shake it off. \\xa0The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon\\nhis hands, and wearied him. \\xa0Once more he felt the sense of captivity\\nheavy upon him.\\n\\nLate in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing\\nwith the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour\\nappointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great\\nofficials and courtiers.\\n\\nAfter a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become\\ninterested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the\\npalace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart\\nto take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting\\nand shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest\\nand poorest degree approaching from up the road.\\n\\n“I would I knew what ’tis about!” he exclaimed, with all a boy’s\\ncuriosity in such happenings.\\n\\n“Thou art the King!” solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.\\n“Have I your Grace’s leave to act?”\\n\\n“O blithely, yes! \\xa0O gladly, yes!” exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to\\nhimself with a lively sense of satisfaction, “In truth, being a king is\\nnot all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences.”\\n\\nThe Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with\\nthe order--\\n\\n“Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its\\nmovement. \\xa0By the King’s command!”\\n\\nA few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing\\nsteel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front\\nof the multitude. \\xa0A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were\\nfollowing a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes\\ncommitted against the peace and dignity of the realm.\\n\\nDeath--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates! \\xa0The thought\\nwrung Tom’s heart-strings. \\xa0The spirit of compassion took control of\\nhim, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of\\nthe offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals\\nhad inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the\\nscaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.\\n\\xa0His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the\\nfalse shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had\\nblurted out the command--\\n\\n“Bring them here!”\\n\\nThen he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but\\nobserving that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or\\nthe waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter. \\xa0The\\npage, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance\\nand retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command. \\xa0Tom\\nexperienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating\\nadvantages of the kingly office. He said to himself, “Truly it is like\\nwhat I was used to feel when I read the old priest’s tales, and did\\nimagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying\\n‘Do this, do that,’ whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my\\nwill.”\\n\\nNow the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was\\nannounced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was\\nquickly half-filled with noble folk and finery. \\xa0But Tom was hardly\\nconscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so\\nintensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter. \\xa0He seated\\nhimself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the\\ndoor with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the\\ncompany forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public\\nbusiness and court gossip one with another.\\n\\nIn a little while the measured tread of military men was heard\\napproaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an\\nunder-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king’s guard. \\xa0The civil\\nofficer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons\\nknelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom’s\\nchair. \\xa0Tom scanned the prisoners curiously. Something about the dress\\nor appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him.  “Methinks\\nI have seen this man ere now . . . but the when or the where fail\\nme.”--Such was Tom’s thought. Just then the man glanced quickly up and\\nquickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port\\nof sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was\\nsufficient. \\xa0He said to himself: “Now is the matter clear; this is the\\nstranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life,\\nthat windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity\\nhe hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case . . . I\\nhave not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after,\\nupon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer\\nCanty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that\\nwent before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by\\ncomparison.”\\n\\nTom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence\\nfor a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--\\n\\n“Good sir, what is this man’s offence?”\\n\\nThe officer knelt, and answered--\\n\\n“So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison.”\\n\\nTom’s compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring\\nrescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock.\\n\\n“The thing was proven upon him?” he asked.\\n\\n“Most clearly, sire.”\\n\\nTom sighed, and said--\\n\\n“Take him away--he hath earned his death.  ‘Tis a pity, for he was a\\nbrave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the _look_ of it!”\\n\\nThe prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung\\nthem despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the ‘King’\\nin broken and terrified phrases--\\n\\n“O my lord the King, an’ thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me! \\xa0I\\nam innocent--neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than\\nbut lamely proved--yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth\\nagainst me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a\\nboon, for my doom is more than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the\\nKing! in thy royal compassion grant my prayer--give commandment that I\\nbe hanged!”\\n\\nTom was amazed. \\xa0This was not the outcome he had looked for.\\n\\n“Odds my life, a strange _boon_! \\xa0Was it not the fate intended thee?”\\n\\n“O good my liege, not so! \\xa0It is ordered that I be _boiled alive_!”\\n\\nThe hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his\\nchair. \\xa0As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out--\\n\\n“Have thy wish, poor soul! an’ thou had poisoned a hundred men thou\\nshouldst not suffer so miserable a death.”\\n\\nThe prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate\\nexpressions of gratitude--ending with--\\n\\n“If ever thou shouldst know misfortune--which God forefend!--may thy\\ngoodness to me this day be remembered and requited!”\\n\\nTom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said--\\n\\n“My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man’s\\nferocious doom?”\\n\\n“It is the law, your Grace--for poisoners. \\xa0In Germany coiners be boiled\\nto death in _oil_--not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into\\nthe oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then--”\\n\\n“O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!” cried Tom, covering\\nhis eyes with his hands to shut out the picture.  “I beseech your good\\nlordship that order be taken to change this law--oh, let no more poor\\ncreatures be visited with its tortures.”\\n\\nThe Earl’s face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of\\nmerciful and generous impulses--a thing not very common with his class\\nin that fierce age. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“These your Grace’s noble words have sealed its doom. \\xa0History will\\nremember it to the honour of your royal house.”\\n\\nThe under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign\\nto wait; then he said--\\n\\n“Good sir, I would look into this matter further. \\xa0The man has said his\\ndeed was but lamely proved. \\xa0Tell me what thou knowest.”\\n\\n“If the King’s grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this\\nman entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay\\nsick--three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and\\ntwo say it was some minutes later--the sick man being alone at the time,\\nand sleeping--and presently the man came forth again and went his\\nway. \\xa0The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and\\nretchings.”\\n\\n“Did any see the poison given? \\xa0Was poison found?”\\n\\n“Marry, no, my liege.”\\n\\n“Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?”\\n\\n“Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such\\nsymptoms but by poison.”\\n\\nWeighty evidence, this, in that simple age. \\xa0Tom recognised its\\nformidable nature, and said--\\n\\n“The doctor knoweth his trade--belike they were right. \\xa0The matter hath\\nan ill-look for this poor man.”\\n\\n“Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many\\ntestified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither,\\ndid foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick\\nman _would die by poison_--and more, that a stranger would give it--a\\nstranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and\\nsurely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill. \\xa0Please your\\nMajesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due,\\nseeing it was _foretold_.”\\n\\nThis was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day. \\xa0Tom\\nfelt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this\\npoor fellow’s guilt was proved. \\xa0Still he offered the prisoner a chance,\\nsaying--\\n\\n“If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.”\\n\\n“Nought that will avail, my King. \\xa0I am innocent, yet cannot I make\\nit appear. \\xa0I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in\\nIslington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I\\nwas above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more,\\nmy King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was _taking_ life, I\\nwas _saving_ it. \\xa0A drowning boy--”\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!”\\n\\n“At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New\\nYear, most illustrious--”\\n\\n“Let the prisoner go free--it is the King’s will!”\\n\\nAnother blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his\\nindecorum as well as he could by adding--\\n\\n“It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained\\nevidence!”\\n\\nA low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. \\xa0It was not\\nadmiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the\\npropriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing\\nwhich few there would have felt justified in either admitting or\\nadmiring--no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which\\nTom had displayed. \\xa0Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect--\\n\\n“This is no mad king--he hath his wits sound.”\\n\\n“How sanely he put his questions--how like his former natural self was\\nthis abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!”\\n\\n“God be thanked, his infirmity is spent! \\xa0This is no weakling, but a\\nking. \\xa0He hath borne himself like to his own father.”\\n\\nThe air being filled with applause, Tom’s ear necessarily caught a\\nlittle of it. \\xa0The effect which this had upon him was to put him\\ngreatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying\\nsensations.\\n\\nHowever, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant\\nthoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief\\nthe woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command,\\nthe two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.\\n\\n“What is it that these have done?” he inquired of the sheriff.\\n\\n“Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly\\nproven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that\\nthey be hanged. \\xa0They sold themselves to the devil--such is their\\ncrime.”\\n\\nTom shuddered. \\xa0He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked\\nthing. \\xa0Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding\\nhis curiosity for all that; so he asked--\\n\\n“Where was this done?--and when?”\\n\\n“On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.”\\n\\nTom shuddered again.\\n\\n“Who was there present?”\\n\\n“Only these two, your grace--and _that other_.”\\n\\n“Have these confessed?”\\n\\n“Nay, not so, sire--they do deny it.”\\n\\n“Then prithee, how was it known?”\\n\\n“Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this\\nbred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified\\nit. \\xa0In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so\\nobtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the\\nregion round about. \\xa0Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and\\nsooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it,\\nsith all had suffered by it.”\\n\\n“Certes this is a serious matter.” \\xa0Tom turned this dark piece of\\nscoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked--\\n\\n“Suffered the woman also by the storm?”\\n\\nSeveral old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of\\nthe wisdom of this question. \\xa0The sheriff, however, saw nothing\\nconsequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness--\\n\\n“Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her\\nhabitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.”\\n\\n“Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She\\nhad been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid\\nher soul, and her child’s, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she\\nknoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.”\\n\\nThe elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom’s wisdom once more, and one\\nindividual murmured, “An’ the King be mad himself, according to report,\\nthen is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I\\nwot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.”\\n\\n“What age hath the child?” asked Tom.\\n\\n“Nine years, please your Majesty.”\\n\\n“By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself,\\nmy lord?” asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.\\n\\n“The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty\\nmatter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope\\nwith the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders. \\xa0The\\n_Devil_ may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto,\\nbut not an Englishman--in this latter case the contract would be null\\nand void.”\\n\\n“It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English\\nlaw denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!” cried\\nTom, with honest heat.\\n\\nThis novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored\\naway in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom’s\\noriginality as well as progress toward mental health.\\n\\nThe elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom’s\\nwords with an excited interest and a growing hope. \\xa0Tom noticed this,\\nand it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and\\nunfriended situation. \\xa0Presently he asked--\\n\\n“How wrought they to bring the storm?”\\n\\n“_By pulling off their stockings_, sire.”\\n\\nThis astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He\\nsaid, eagerly--\\n\\n“It is wonderful! \\xa0Hath it always this dread effect?”\\n\\n“Always, my liege--at least if the woman desire it, and utter the\\nneedful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.”\\n\\nTom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal--\\n\\n“Exert thy power--I would see a storm!”\\n\\nThere was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and\\na general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place--all of\\nwhich was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed\\ncataclysm. \\xa0Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman’s face, he\\nadded, excitedly--\\n\\n“Never fear--thou shalt be blameless. \\xa0More--thou shalt go free--none\\nshall touch thee. \\xa0Exert thy power.”\\n\\n“Oh, my lord the King, I have it not--I have been falsely accused.”\\n\\n“Thy fears stay thee. \\xa0Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.\\n\\xa0Make a storm--it mattereth not how small a one--I require nought great\\nor harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite--do this and thy life is\\nspared--thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King’s\\npardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.”\\n\\nThe woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had\\nno power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child’s life\\nalone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King’s\\ncommand so precious a grace might be acquired.\\n\\nTom urged--the woman still adhered to her declarations. \\xa0Finally he\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I think the woman hath said true. \\xa0An’ _my_ mother were in her place\\nand gifted with the devil’s functions, she had not stayed a moment to\\ncall her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my\\nforfeit life were the price she got! \\xa0It is argument that other\\nmothers are made in like mould. \\xa0Thou art free, goodwife--thou and thy\\nchild--for I do think thee innocent. \\xa0_Now_ thou’st nought to fear,\\nbeing pardoned--pull off thy stockings!--an’ thou canst make me a storm,\\nthou shalt be rich!”\\n\\nThe redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to\\nobey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred\\nby apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided\\ndiscomfort and uneasiness. \\xa0The woman stripped her own feet and her\\nlittle girl’s also, and plainly did her best to reward the King’s\\ngenerosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a\\ndisappointment. \\xa0Tom sighed, and said--\\n\\n“There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed\\nout of thee. \\xa0Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time,\\nforget me not, but fetch me a storm.” {13}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI. The State Dinner.\\n\\nThe dinner hour drew near--yet strangely enough, the thought brought\\nbut slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror. \\xa0The morning’s\\nexperiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little\\nash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four\\ndays’ habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month. \\xa0A\\nchild’s facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more\\nstrikingly illustrated.\\n\\nLet us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a\\nglance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the\\nimposing occasion. \\xa0It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars\\nand pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings. \\xa0At the door stand tall\\nguards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes,\\nand bearing halberds. \\xa0In a high gallery which runs all around the place\\nis a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes,\\nin brilliant attire. \\xa0In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform,\\nis Tom’s table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:\\n\\n“A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another\\nbearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times\\nwith the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after\\nkneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod\\nagain, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have\\nkneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the\\ntable, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first;\\nat last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife,\\nwho, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful\\nmanner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe\\nas if the King had been present.” {6}\\n\\nSo end the solemn preliminaries. \\xa0Now, far down the echoing corridors\\nwe hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, “Place for the King!\\n\\xa0Way for the King’s most excellent majesty!” \\xa0These sounds are momently\\nrepeated--they grow nearer and nearer--and presently, almost in our\\nfaces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, “Way for the King!”\\n \\xa0At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door,\\nwith a measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:--\\n\\n“First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly\\ndressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of\\nwhich carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red\\nscabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next\\ncomes the King himself--whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and\\nmany drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the\\ngalleries rise in their places, crying ‘God save the King!’ \\xa0After him\\ncome nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his\\nguard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes.”\\n\\nThis was all fine and pleasant. \\xa0Tom’s pulse beat high, and a glad light\\nwas in his eye. \\xa0He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more\\nso because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being\\ncharmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him--and\\nbesides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful\\nclothes after he has grown a little used to them--especially if he is\\nfor the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and\\nacknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head,\\nand a courteous “I thank ye, my good people.”\\n\\nHe seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without\\nthe least embarrassment; for to eat with one’s cap on was the one\\nsolitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon\\ncommon ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the\\nmatter of old familiarity with it. \\xa0The pageant broke up and grouped\\nitself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.\\n\\nNow to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,--“the\\ntallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in\\nthis regard”--but we will let the chronicler tell about it:--\\n\\n“The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with\\ngolden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each\\nturn a course of dishes, served in plate. \\xa0These dishes were received\\nby a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon\\nthe table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the\\nparticular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison.”\\n\\nTom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds\\nof eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an\\ninterest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly\\nexplosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about\\nthe place. \\xa0He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do\\nanything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt\\ndown and did it for him. \\xa0He got through without a mistake--flawless and\\nprecious triumph.\\n\\nWhen the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his\\nbright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles,\\nrolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen\\nthe worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad\\nto endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself\\nfree from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII. Foo-foo the First.\\n\\nMiles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge,\\nkeeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and\\nexpecting to overtake them presently. \\xa0He was disappointed in this,\\nhowever. \\xa0By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the\\nway through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as\\nto how to proceed. \\xa0Still, he continued his efforts as best he\\ncould during the rest of the day. \\xa0Nightfall found him leg-weary,\\nhalf-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so\\nhe supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early\\nstart in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search. \\xa0As he lay\\nthinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus: \\xa0The boy would\\nescape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go\\nback to London and seek his former haunts? \\xa0No, he would not do that,\\nhe would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do? \\xa0Never having had a\\nfriend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would\\nnaturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not\\nrequire him to go toward London and danger. \\xa0He would strike for Hendon\\nHall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound\\nand there he might expect to find him. \\xa0Yes, the case was plain to\\nHendon--he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through\\nKent, toward Monk’s Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went.\\n\\xa0Let us return to the vanished little King now.\\n\\nThe ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw ‘about to join’\\nthe youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close\\nbehind them and followed their steps. \\xa0He said nothing. His left arm was\\nin a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped\\nslightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. \\xa0The youth led the King\\na crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the\\nhigh road beyond. \\xa0The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop\\nhere--it was Hendon’s place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. \\xa0He\\nwould not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. \\xa0The youth\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Thou’lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder?\\n\\xa0So be it, then.”\\n\\nThe King’s manner changed at once. \\xa0He cried out--\\n\\n“Wounded? \\xa0And who hath dared to do it? \\xa0But that is apart; lead on,\\nlead on! \\xa0Faster, sirrah! \\xa0Art shod with lead? \\xa0Wounded, is he? \\xa0Now\\nthough the doer of it be a duke’s son he shall rue it!”\\n\\nIt was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.\\nThe youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground,\\nwith a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest,\\nwatching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were\\nevidently guides to the point he was aiming at. \\xa0By-and-by an open place\\nwas reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near\\nthem a barn which was falling to ruin and decay. \\xa0There was no sign of\\nlife anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. \\xa0The youth entered the barn,\\nthe King following eagerly upon his heels. \\xa0No one there! The King shot\\na surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked--\\n\\n“Where is he?”\\n\\nA mocking laugh was his answer. \\xa0The King was in a rage in a moment; he\\nseized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth\\nwhen another mocking laugh fell upon his ear. \\xa0It was from the lame\\nruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said\\nangrily--\\n\\n“Who art thou? \\xa0What is thy business here?”\\n\\n“Leave thy foolery,” said the man, “and quiet thyself. \\xa0My disguise is\\nnone so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through\\nit.”\\n\\n“Thou art not my father. \\xa0I know thee not. \\xa0I am the King. \\xa0If thou hast\\nhid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou\\nhast done.”\\n\\nJohn Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice--\\n\\n“It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; \\xa0but if thou\\nprovoke me, I must. \\xa0Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are\\nno ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy\\ntongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change.\\n\\xa0I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home--neither shalt thou,\\nseeing I need thy service. \\xa0My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is\\nHobbs--John Hobbs; thine is Jack--charge thy memory accordingly. \\xa0Now,\\nthen, speak. \\xa0Where is thy mother? \\xa0Where are thy sisters? \\xa0They came\\nnot to the place appointed--knowest thou whither they went?”\\n\\nThe King answered sullenly--\\n\\n“Trouble me not with these riddles. \\xa0My mother is dead; my sisters are\\nin the palace.”\\n\\nThe youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have\\nassaulted him, but Canty--or Hobbs, as he now called himself--prevented\\nhim, and said--\\n\\n“Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.\\nSit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat,\\nanon.”\\n\\nHobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King\\nremoved himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company.\\n\\xa0He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where\\nhe found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw. \\xa0He lay down\\nhere, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed\\nin thinking. \\xa0He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost\\ninto forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father. \\xa0To\\nthe rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and\\nsuggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand\\ndealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only\\nsensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that\\nwas all gentleness and affection. \\xa0He called to mind a long succession\\nof loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon\\nthem, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that\\npossessed his heart. As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with\\nhis troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.\\n\\nAfter a considerable time--he could not tell how long--his senses\\nstruggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes\\nvaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a\\nmurmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense\\nof comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment,\\nby a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter. \\xa0It startled him\\ndisagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption\\nproceeded. \\xa0A grim and unsightly picture met his eye. \\xa0A bright fire was\\nburning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and\\naround it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the\\nmotliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he\\nhad ever read or dreamed of. \\xa0There were huge stalwart men, brown\\nwith exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were\\nmiddle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there\\nwere blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones,\\nwith wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping\\nfrom ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with\\nhis pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the\\nimplements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls,\\nsome were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud,\\nbrazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three\\nsore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings\\nabout their necks, whose office was to lead the blind.\\n\\nThe night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was\\nbeginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general\\ncry broke forth--\\n\\n“A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!”\\n\\nOne of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches\\nthat sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which\\nrecited the cause of his calamity. \\xa0Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself\\nof his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs,\\nbeside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty,\\nand were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in\\na rousing chorus. \\xa0By the time the last stanza was reached, the\\nhalf-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined\\nin and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of\\nvillainous sound that made the rafters quake. \\xa0These were the inspiring\\nwords:--\\n\\n‘Bien Darkman’s then, Bouse Mort and Ken, The bien Coves bings awast, On\\nChates to trine by Rome Coves dine For his long lib at last. Bing’d out\\nbien Morts and toure, and toure, Bing out of the Rome vile bine, And\\ntoure the Cove that cloy’d your duds, Upon the Chates to trine.’\\n\\n(From’The English Rogue.’ London, 1665.)\\n\\nConversation followed; not in the thieves’ dialect of the song, for that\\nwas only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening. \\xa0In the\\ncourse of it, it appeared that ‘John Hobbs’ was not altogether a new\\nrecruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time. \\xa0His later\\nhistory was called for, and when he said he had ‘accidentally’ killed a\\nman, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the\\nman was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with\\neverybody. \\xa0Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were\\nproud to shake him by the hand. \\xa0He was asked why he had ’tarried away\\nso many months.’ \\xa0He answered--\\n\\n“London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the\\nlaws be so bitter and so diligently enforced. \\xa0An’ I had not had that\\naccident, I had stayed there. \\xa0I had resolved to stay, and never more\\nventure country-wards--but the accident has ended that.”\\n\\nHe inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. \\xa0The ‘ruffler,’ or\\nchief, answered--\\n\\n“Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and\\nmaunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. {7} \\xa0Most are\\nhere, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow\\nat dawn.”\\n\\n“I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me. \\xa0Where may he be?”\\n\\n“Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate\\ntaste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer.”\\n\\n“I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave.”\\n\\n“That was he, truly. \\xa0Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on\\nthe eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none\\never seeing her drunk above four days in the seven.”\\n\\n“She was ever strict--I remember it well--a goodly wench and worthy\\nall commendation. \\xa0Her mother was more free and less particular; a\\ntroublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above\\nthe common.”\\n\\n“We lost her through it. \\xa0Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of\\nfortune-telling begot for her at last a witch’s name and fame. The\\nlaw roasted her to death at a slow fire. \\xa0It did touch me to a sort of\\ntenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot--cursing and reviling\\nall the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked\\nupward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about\\nher old gray head--cursing them! why an’ thou should’st live a thousand\\nyears thoud’st never hear so masterful a cursing. \\xa0Alack, her art died\\nwith her. \\xa0There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true\\nblasphemy.”\\n\\nThe Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general\\ndepression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened\\noutcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to\\nfeel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and\\nunder peculiarly favouring circumstances--as in cases like to this, for\\ninstance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir. \\xa0However, a\\ndeep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.\\n\\n“Have any others of our friends fared hardly?” asked Hobbs.\\n\\n“Some--yes. \\xa0Particularly new comers--such as small husbandmen turned\\nshiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from\\nthem to be changed to sheep ranges. \\xa0They begged, and were whipped at\\nthe cart’s tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set\\nin the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and\\ndeprived of an ear; they begged a third time--poor devils, what else\\ncould they do?--and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then\\nsold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged.  ‘Tis\\na brief tale, and quickly told. \\xa0Others of us have fared less hardly.\\nStand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge--show your adornments!”\\n\\nThese stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their\\nbacks, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned\\nup his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another\\nshowed a brand upon his shoulder--the letter V--and a mutilated ear; the\\nthird said--\\n\\n“I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and\\nkids--now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife\\nand kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in--in the other\\nplace--but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in _England_!\\n\\xa0My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick;\\none of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for\\na witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed. \\xa0English law!--up,\\nall, with your cups!--now all together and with a cheer!--drink to the\\nmerciful English law that delivered _her_ from the English hell! \\xa0Thank\\nyou, mates, one and all. \\xa0I begged, from house to house--I and the\\nwife--bearing with us the hungry kids--but it was crime to be hungry in\\nEngland--so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns. \\xa0Drink\\nye all again to the merciful English law!--for its lash drank deep of my\\nMary’s blood and its blessed deliverance came quick. \\xa0She lies there, in\\nthe potter’s field, safe from all harms. \\xa0And the kids--well, whilst\\nthe law lashed me from town to town, they starved. Drink, lads--only\\na drop--a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm.\\n\\xa0I begged again--begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an\\near--see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump\\nof the other to keep me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was\\nsold for a slave--here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off,\\nye might see the red S the branding-iron left there! \\xa0A _slave_! \\xa0Do\\nyou understand that word? \\xa0An English _slave_!--that is he that stands\\nbefore ye. \\xa0I have run from my master, and when I am found--the heavy\\ncurse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!--I\\nshall hang!” {1}\\n\\nA ringing voice came through the murky air--\\n\\n“Thou shalt _not_!--and this day the end of that law is come!”\\n\\nAll turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching\\nhurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a\\ngeneral explosion of inquiries broke out--\\n\\n“Who is it? \\xa0_What_ is it? \\xa0Who art thou, manikin?”\\n\\nThe boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and\\nquestioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity--\\n\\n“I am Edward, King of England.”\\n\\nA wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of\\ndelight in the excellence of the joke. \\xa0The King was stung. \\xa0He said\\nsharply--\\n\\n“Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I\\nhave promised?”\\n\\nHe said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in\\na whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.  ‘John Hobbs’ made\\nseveral attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last\\nsucceeded--saying--\\n\\n“Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad--mind him not--he\\nthinketh he _is_ the King.”\\n\\n“I _am_ the King,” said Edward, turning toward him, “as thou shalt know\\nto thy cost, in good time. \\xa0Thou hast confessed a murder--thou shalt\\nswing for it.”\\n\\n“_Thou’lt_ betray me?--_thou_? \\xa0An’ I get my hands upon thee--”\\n\\n“Tut-tut!” said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the\\nKing, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist,\\n“hast respect for neither Kings _nor_ Rufflers? \\xa0An’ thou insult my\\npresence so again, I’ll hang thee up myself.” \\xa0Then he said to his\\nMajesty, “Thou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou\\nmust guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere. \\xa0_Be king_, if\\nit please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it. \\xa0Sink the title thou\\nhast uttered--‘tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but\\nnone among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving\\nand loyal hearts, in that regard. \\xa0Note if I speak truth. \\xa0Now--all\\ntogether:  ‘Long live Edward, King of England!’”\\n\\n“LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!”\\n\\nThe response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the\\ncrazy building vibrated to the sound. \\xa0The little King’s face lighted\\nwith pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and\\nsaid with grave simplicity--\\n\\n“I thank you, my good people.”\\n\\nThis unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.\\nWhen something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said,\\nfirmly, but with an accent of good nature--\\n\\n“Drop it, boy, ’tis not wise, nor well. \\xa0Humour thy fancy, if thou must,\\nbut choose some other title.”\\n\\nA tinker shrieked out a suggestion--\\n\\n“Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!”\\n\\nThe title ’took,’ at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout\\nwent up, of--\\n\\n“Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!” followed by\\nhootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.\\n\\n“Hale him forth, and crown him!”\\n\\n“Robe him!”\\n\\n“Sceptre him!”\\n\\n“Throne him!”\\n\\nThese and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the\\npoor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin,\\nrobed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with\\nthe tinker’s soldering-iron. \\xa0Then all flung themselves upon their\\nknees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking\\nsupplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and\\nragged sleeves and aprons--\\n\\n“Be gracious to us, O sweet King!”\\n\\n“Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!”\\n\\n“Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!”\\n\\n“Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of\\nsovereignty!”\\n\\n“Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the\\ndirt and be ennobled!”\\n\\n“Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children’s children may tell of\\nthy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!”\\n\\nBut the humorous tinker made the ‘hit’ of the evening and carried off\\nthe honours. \\xa0Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King’s foot, and was\\nindignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste\\nover the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying\\nit must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he\\nshould make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to\\nview at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight. \\xa0He made himself so\\nkillingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy\\nrabble.\\n\\nTears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch’s eyes; and\\nthe thought in his heart was, “Had I offered them a deep wrong they\\ncould not be more cruel--yet have I proffered nought but to do them a\\nkindness--and it is thus they use me for it!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII. The Prince with the Tramps.\\n\\nThe troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on\\ntheir march. \\xa0There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under\\nfoot, and a winter chill in the air. \\xa0All gaiety was gone from the\\ncompany; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant,\\nnone were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.\\n\\nThe Ruffler put ‘Jack’ in Hugo’s charge, with some brief instructions,\\nand commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he\\nalso warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.\\n\\nAfter a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.\\nThe troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. \\xa0They\\ngrew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and\\ninsult passengers along the highway. \\xa0This showed that they were awaking\\nto an appreciation of life and its joys once more. \\xa0The dread in which\\ntheir sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them\\nthe road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing\\nto talk back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full\\nview of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that\\nthey did not take the hedges, too.\\n\\nBy-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home\\nwhile the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to\\nfurnish a breakfast for them. \\xa0They chucked the housewife and her\\ndaughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and\\nmade coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and\\nbursts of horse-laughter. \\xa0They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer\\nand his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously\\nwhen a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of\\nthe daughters who resented some of their familiarities. \\xa0When they took\\ntheir leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the\\nheads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the\\nauthorities.\\n\\nAbout noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind\\na hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village. \\xa0An hour was allowed\\nfor rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village\\nat different points to ply their various trades--‘Jack’ was sent with\\nHugo. \\xa0They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching\\nfor opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none--so he\\nfinally said--\\n\\n“I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place. \\xa0Wherefore we will beg.”\\n\\n“_We_, forsooth! \\xa0Follow thy trade--it befits thee. \\xa0But _I_ will not\\nbeg.”\\n\\n“Thou’lt not beg!” exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.\\n“Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?”\\n\\n“What dost thou mean?”\\n\\n“Mean? \\xa0Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?”\\n\\n“I? \\xa0Thou idiot!”\\n\\n“Spare thy compliments--thy stock will last the longer. \\xa0Thy father says\\nthou hast begged all thy days. \\xa0Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will\\neven make so bold as to _say_ he lied,” scoffed Hugo.\\n\\n“Him _you_ call my father? \\xa0Yes, he lied.”\\n\\n“Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy\\namusement, not thy hurt. \\xa0An’ I tell him this, he will scorch thee\\nfinely for it.”\\n\\n“Save thyself the trouble. \\xa0I will tell him.”\\n\\n“I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.\\nBone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going\\nout of one’s way to invite them. \\xa0But a truce to these matters; _I_\\nbelieve your father. \\xa0I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he _doth_\\nlie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion\\nhere. \\xa0A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for\\nnought. \\xa0But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging,\\nwherewithal shall we busy ourselves? \\xa0With robbing kitchens?”\\n\\nThe King said, impatiently--\\n\\n“Have done with this folly--you weary me!”\\n\\nHugo replied, with temper--\\n\\n“Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I\\nwill tell you what you _will_ do. \\xa0You will play decoy whilst _I_ beg.\\nRefuse, an’ you think you may venture!”\\n\\nThe King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,\\ninterrupting--\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0Here comes one with a kindly face. \\xa0Now will I fall down in\\na fit. \\xa0When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon\\nyour knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery\\nwere in your belly, and say, ‘Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother,\\nand we be friendless; o’ God’s name cast through your merciful eyes one\\npitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow\\none little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready\\nto perish!’--and mind you, keep you _on_ wailing, and abate not till we\\nbilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it.”\\n\\nThen immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and\\nreel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he\\nsprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in\\nthe dirt, in seeming agony.\\n\\n“O, dear, O dear!” cried the benevolent stranger, “O poor soul, poor\\nsoul, how he doth suffer! \\xa0There--let me help thee up.”\\n\\n“O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman--but it\\ngiveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so. \\xa0My brother there\\nwill tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be\\nupon me. \\xa0A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave\\nme to my sorrows.”\\n\\n“A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,”--and he fumbled\\nin his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. “There, poor lad,\\ntake them and most welcome. \\xa0Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry\\nthy stricken brother to yon house, where--”\\n\\n“I am not his brother,” said the King, interrupting.\\n\\n“What! not his brother?”\\n\\n“Oh, hear him!” groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. “He\\ndenies his own brother--and he with one foot in the grave!”\\n\\n“Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother. \\xa0For\\nshame!--and he scarce able to move hand or foot. \\xa0If he is not thy\\nbrother, who is he, then?”\\n\\n“A beggar and a thief! \\xa0He has got your money and has picked your pocket\\nlikewise. \\xa0An’ thou would’st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over\\nhis shoulders and trust Providence for the rest.”\\n\\nBut Hugo did not tarry for the miracle. \\xa0In a moment he was up and off\\nlike the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry\\nlustily as he went. \\xa0The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for\\nhis own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken\\nhis pace until he was out of harm’s reach. \\xa0He took the first road that\\noffered, and soon put the village behind him. \\xa0He hurried along, as\\nbriskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over\\nhis shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful\\nsense of security took their place. \\xa0He recognised, now, that he was\\nhungry, and also very tired. \\xa0So he halted at a farmhouse; but when\\nhe was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away. \\xa0His\\nclothes were against him.\\n\\nHe wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself\\nin the way of like treatment no more. \\xa0But hunger is pride’s master; so,\\nas the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but\\nhere he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was\\npromised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.\\n\\nThe night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch\\nlaboured slowly on. \\xa0He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he\\nsat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold. \\xa0All\\nhis sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom\\nand the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him. \\xa0At\\nintervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and\\nas he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of\\nformless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about\\nit all that made him shudder. \\xa0Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a\\nlight--always far away, apparently--almost in another world; if he heard\\nthe tinkle of a sheep’s bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct;\\nthe muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in\\nvanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining\\nhowl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds\\nwere remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity\\nwere far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in\\nthe centre of a measureless solitude.\\n\\nHe stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new\\nexperience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves\\noverhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he\\ncame suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand. \\xa0He\\nstepped back into the shadows and waited. \\xa0The lantern stood by the\\nopen door of a barn. \\xa0The King waited some time--there was no sound,\\nand nobody stirring. \\xa0He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable\\nbarn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and\\nenter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing\\nthe threshold he heard voices behind him. \\xa0He darted behind a cask,\\nwithin the barn, and stooped down. \\xa0Two farm-labourers came in, bringing\\nthe lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile. \\xa0Whilst they\\nmoved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took\\nthe bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end\\nof the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to\\nhimself. \\xa0He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway\\nof the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the\\ncrown of England for one night.\\n\\nBy-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind\\nthem and taking the lantern with them. \\xa0The shivering King made for the\\nblankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them\\nup, and then groped his way safely to the stall. \\xa0Of two of the blankets\\nhe made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two. \\xa0He was a\\nglad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite\\nwarm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost\\nsuffocatingly powerful.\\n\\nAlthough the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so\\ndrowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage\\nof the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of\\nsemi-consciousness. \\xa0Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself\\nwholly, he distinctly felt something touch him! \\xa0He was broad awake in\\na moment, and gasping for breath. \\xa0The cold horror of that mysterious\\ntouch in the dark almost made his heart stand still. \\xa0He lay motionless,\\nand listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was\\nno sound. \\xa0He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long\\ntime, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound. \\xa0So he began\\nto drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that\\nmysterious touch again! \\xa0It was a grisly thing, this light touch from\\nthis noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly\\nfears. \\xa0What should he do? \\xa0That was the question; but he did not know\\nhow to answer it. \\xa0Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters\\nand fly from this inscrutable horror? \\xa0But fly whither? \\xa0He could\\nnot get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and\\nthither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this\\nphantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch\\nupon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable. \\xa0But to stay\\nwhere he was, and endure this living death all night--was that better?\\n\\xa0No. \\xa0What, then, was there left to do? \\xa0Ah, there was but one course;\\nhe knew it well--he must put out his hand and find that thing!\\n\\nIt was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try\\nit. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,\\ngingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp--not because it\\nhad encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just\\n_going_ to. \\xa0But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his\\nhand lightly swept against something soft and warm. \\xa0This petrified him,\\nnearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine\\nthe thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.\\nHe thought he would rather die than touch it again. \\xa0But he thought this\\nfalse thought because he did not know the immortal strength of\\nhuman curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping\\nagain--against his judgment, and without his consent--but groping\\npersistently on, just the same. \\xa0It encountered a bunch of long hair; he\\nshuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm\\nrope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!--for the rope was\\nnot a rope at all, but the calf’s tail.\\n\\nThe King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that\\nfright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he\\nneed not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened\\nhim, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and\\nany other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and\\nsuffered just as he had done.\\n\\nThe King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a\\ncalf, but delighted to have the calf’s company; for he had been feeling\\nso lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even\\nthis humble animal were welcome. \\xa0And he had been so buffeted, so rudely\\nentreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel\\nthat he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at\\nleast a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes\\nmight be lacking. \\xa0So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with\\nthe calf.\\n\\nWhile stroking its sleek warm back--for it lay near him and within easy\\nreach--it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways\\nthan one. \\xa0Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to\\nthe calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf’s back, drew the covers\\nup over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and\\ncomfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace\\nof Westminster.\\n\\nPleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming. \\xa0He\\nwas free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship\\nof base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he\\nwas happy. \\xa0The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts\\nthat made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down\\nat intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and\\nprojections--but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and\\ncomfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan\\nand wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it. \\xa0He merely snuggled\\nthe closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted\\nblissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that\\nwas full of serenity and peace. \\xa0The distant dogs howled, the melancholy\\nkine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets\\nof rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on,\\nundisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and\\nnot easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX. The Prince with the peasants.\\n\\nWhen the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but\\nthoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy\\nbed for itself in his bosom. \\xa0Being disturbed now, it scampered away.\\nThe boy smiled, and said, “Poor fool, why so fearful? \\xa0I am as forlorn\\nas thou.  ‘Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so\\nhelpless. \\xa0Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king\\nhas fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely\\nmeaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no\\nlower go.”\\n\\nHe got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound\\nof children’s voices. \\xa0The barn door opened and a couple of little girls\\ncame in. \\xa0As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and\\nthey stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they\\npresently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and\\nstopped again to gaze and whisper. \\xa0By-and-by they gathered courage and\\nbegan to discuss him aloud. \\xa0One said--\\n\\n“He hath a comely face.”\\n\\nThe other added--\\n\\n“And pretty hair.”\\n\\n“But is ill clothed enow.”\\n\\n“And how starved he looketh.”\\n\\nThey came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining\\nhim minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of\\nanimal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he\\nmight be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion. \\xa0Finally they\\nhalted before him, holding each other’s hands for protection, and took a\\ngood satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked\\nup all her courage and inquired with honest directness--\\n\\n“Who art thou, boy?”\\n\\n“I am the King,” was the grave answer.\\n\\nThe children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide\\nopen and remained so during a speechless half minute. \\xa0Then curiosity\\nbroke the silence--\\n\\n“The _King_? \\xa0What King?”\\n\\n“The King of England.”\\n\\nThe children looked at each other--then at him--then at each other\\nagain--wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said--\\n\\n“Didst hear him, Margery?--he said he is the King. \\xa0Can that be true?”\\n\\n“How can it be else but true, Prissy? \\xa0Would he say a lie? \\xa0For look\\nyou, Prissy, an’ it were not true, it _would_ be a lie. \\xa0It surely would\\nbe. Now think on’t. \\xa0For all things that be not true, be lies--thou\\ncanst make nought else out of it.”\\n\\nIt was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left\\nPrissy’s half-doubts not a leg to stand on. \\xa0She considered a moment,\\nthen put the King upon his honour with the simple remark--\\n\\n“If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee.”\\n\\n“I am truly the King.”\\n\\nThis settled the matter. \\xa0His Majesty’s royalty was accepted without\\nfurther question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once\\nto inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so\\nunroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs. \\xa0It\\nwas a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not\\nbe scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting\\neven his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and\\ntenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids. \\xa0But when he got down\\nto his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without\\nfood, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a\\nbreakfast for him.\\n\\nThe King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, “When I\\nam come to mine own again, I will always honour little children,\\nremembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time\\nof trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser,\\nmocked at me and held me for a liar.”\\n\\nThe children’s mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity;\\nfor his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her\\nwomanly heart. \\xa0She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had\\nseen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate. \\xa0She\\nimagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or\\nkeepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that\\nshe might take measures to return him; but all her references to\\nneighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line\\nwent for nothing--the boy’s face, and his answers, too, showed that the\\nthings she was talking of were not familiar to him. \\xa0He spoke earnestly\\nand simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when\\nspeaking of the late King ‘his father’; but whenever the conversation\\nchanged to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.\\n\\nThe woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up. \\xa0As she\\nproceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to\\nsurprise the boy into betraying his real secret. \\xa0She talked about\\ncattle--he showed no concern; then about sheep--the same result: \\xa0so\\nher guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about\\nmills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all\\nsorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats: \\xa0but no\\nmatter, she was baffled at all points. \\xa0Not altogether, either; for she\\nargued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service. \\xa0Yes,\\nshe was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house\\nservant. \\xa0So she led up to that. \\xa0But the result was discouraging. The\\nsubject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir\\nhim; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,\\nwith a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject\\nof cooking. \\xa0To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King’s face\\nlighted at once! \\xa0Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and\\nshe was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had\\naccomplished it.\\n\\nHer tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King’s, inspired\\nby gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering\\npots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an\\neloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three\\nminutes the woman said to herself, “Of a truth I was right--he hath\\nholpen in a kitchen!” \\xa0Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed\\nit with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to\\nherself, “Good lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones\\nwithal? \\xa0For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great.\\n\\xa0Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the\\npalace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the\\nvery kitchen of the King himself! \\xa0I will test him.”\\n\\nFull of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the\\ncooking a moment--hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or\\ntwo, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a\\nsign to follow after. \\xa0The King muttered--\\n\\n“Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone\\ntime--it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the\\ngreat Alfred stooped to assume. \\xa0But I will try to better serve my trust\\nthan he; for he let the cakes burn.”\\n\\nThe intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for\\nthis King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning\\nhis vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted--the cookery got\\nburned. The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire\\ndestruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a\\nbrisk and cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was\\nover his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and\\ngentleness toward him.\\n\\nThe boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and\\ngladdened by it. \\xa0It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious\\nfeature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient\\nof the favour was aware that it had been extended. \\xa0The goodwife had\\nintended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner,\\nlike any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the\\nscolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it\\nby allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on\\nostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was\\nso remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so\\nkind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself\\nto the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to\\nstand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary\\nstate due to his birth and dignity. \\xa0It does us all good to unbend\\nsometimes. \\xa0This good woman was made happy all the day long by the\\napplauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension\\nto a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious\\nhumility toward a humble peasant woman.\\n\\nWhen breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the\\ndishes. \\xa0This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came\\nnear rebelling; but then he said to himself, “Alfred the Great watched\\nthe cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too--therefore will\\nI essay it.”\\n\\nHe made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the\\ncleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.\\nIt was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it\\nat last. \\xa0He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now;\\nhowever, he was not to lose this thrifty dame’s society so easily. \\xa0She\\nfurnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got\\nthrough with after a fair fashion and with some credit. \\xa0Then she set\\nhim and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so\\nawkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a\\nbutcher knife to grind.\\n\\nAfterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid\\nthe good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in\\nthe matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in\\nstory-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign. \\xa0And\\nwhen, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket\\nof kittens to drown, he did resign. \\xa0At least he was just going to\\nresign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it\\nseemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right\\nthing--when there was an interruption. \\xa0The interruption was John\\nCanty--with a peddler’s pack on his back--and Hugo.\\n\\nThe King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they\\nhad had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line,\\nbut took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way,\\nwithout a word. \\xa0He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on,\\ninto a narrow lane at the rear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX. The Prince and the hermit.\\n\\nThe high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of\\na deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the\\ndistance. \\xa0He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter\\nof the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.\\nThat was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but\\nhurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the\\ntwilight depths of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he\\nwas now tolerably safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was\\nprofound and solemn--awful, even, and depressing to the spirits. \\xa0At\\nwide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so\\nremote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real\\nsounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed\\nones. \\xa0So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they\\ninterrupted.\\n\\nIt was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of\\nthe day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at\\nlast obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight\\nthrough the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was\\ndisappointed in this. \\xa0He travelled on and on; but the farther he went,\\nthe denser the wood became, apparently. \\xa0The gloom began to thicken,\\nby-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on. \\xa0It made\\nhim shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he\\ntried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could\\nnot now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he\\nkept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.\\n\\nAnd how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He\\napproached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen. \\xa0It\\ncame from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut. \\xa0He heard\\na voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his\\nmind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently. \\xa0He glided to the\\none window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance\\nwithin. \\xa0The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten\\nhard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or\\ntwo; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans;\\nthere was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the\\nremains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was\\nlighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box\\nat his side lay an open book and a human skull. \\xa0The man was of large,\\nbony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he\\nwas clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his\\nheels.\\n\\n“A holy hermit!” said the King to himself; “now am I indeed fortunate.”\\n\\nThe hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked. \\xa0A deep voice\\nresponded--\\n\\n“Enter!--but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand\\nis holy!”\\n\\nThe King entered, and paused. \\xa0The hermit turned a pair of gleaming,\\nunrestful eyes upon him, and said--\\n\\n“Who art thou?”\\n\\n“I am the King,” came the answer, with placid simplicity.\\n\\n“Welcome, King!” cried the hermit, with enthusiasm. \\xa0Then, bustling\\nabout with feverish activity, and constantly saying, “Welcome, welcome,”\\n he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some\\nfaggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous\\nstride.\\n\\n“Welcome! \\xa0Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy,\\nand were turned away. \\xa0But a King who casts his crown away, and despises\\nthe vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to\\ndevote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh--he is\\nworthy, he is welcome!--here shall he abide all his days till death\\ncome.” \\xa0The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid\\nno attention to him--did not even hear him, apparently, but went right\\non with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy.  “And thou\\nshalt be at peace here. \\xa0None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee\\nwith supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God\\nhath moved thee to abandon. \\xa0Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the\\nBook; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world,\\nand upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon\\ncrusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the\\npurifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin;\\nthou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at\\npeace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he\\nshall not find thee, he shall not molest thee.”\\n\\nThe old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and\\nbegan to mutter. \\xa0The King seized this opportunity to state his case;\\nand he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension.\\n\\xa0But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed. \\xa0And still\\nmuttering, he approached the King and said impressively--\\n\\n“‘Sh! \\xa0I will tell you a secret!” \\xa0He bent down to impart it, but\\nchecked himself, and assumed a listening attitude. \\xa0After a moment\\nor two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and\\npeered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his\\nface close down to the King’s, and whispered--\\n\\n“I am an archangel!”\\n\\nThe King started violently, and said to himself, “Would God I were with\\nthe outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!” \\xa0His\\napprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face. \\xa0In\\na low excited voice the hermit continued--\\n\\n“I see you feel my atmosphere! \\xa0There’s awe in your face! \\xa0None may\\nbe in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very\\natmosphere of heaven. \\xa0I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an\\neye. \\xa0I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago,\\nby angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity. \\xa0Their presence\\nfilled this place with an intolerable brightness. \\xa0And they knelt to me,\\nKing! yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they. \\xa0I have walked\\nin the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs. \\xa0Touch\\nmy hand--be not afraid--touch it. \\xa0There--now thou hast touched a hand\\nwhich has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob! \\xa0For I have\\nwalked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!” \\xa0He\\npaused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and\\nhe started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, “Yes, I am an\\narchangel; _a mere archangel!_--I that might have been pope! \\xa0It is\\nverily true. \\xa0I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago;\\nah, yes, I was to be pope!--and I _should_ have been pope, for Heaven\\nhad said it--but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor\\nobscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my\\nmighty destiny!” Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in\\nfutile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse,\\nand now and then a pathetic “Wherefore I am nought but an archangel--I\\nthat should have been pope!”\\n\\nSo he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and\\nsuffered. Then all at once the old man’s frenzy departed, and he became\\nall gentleness. \\xa0His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and\\nfell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the\\nKing’s heart completely. \\xa0The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the\\nfire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions\\nwith a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a\\nsupper--chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the\\nlad’s cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in\\na little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were\\nchanged to reverence and affection for the man.\\n\\nThis happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then,\\nafter a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a\\nsmall adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother\\nmight; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the\\nfire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.\\nPresently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his\\nfingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his\\nmind. \\xa0Apparently he was unsuccessful. \\xa0Now he started quickly up, and\\nentered his guest’s room, and said--\\n\\n“Thou art King?”\\n\\n“Yes,” was the response, drowsily uttered.\\n\\n“What King?”\\n\\n“Of England.”\\n\\n“Of England? \\xa0Then Henry is gone!”\\n\\n“Alack, it is so. \\xa0I am his son.”\\n\\nA black frown settled down upon the hermit’s face, and he clenched his\\nbony hands with a vindictive energy. \\xa0He stood a few moments, breathing\\nfast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice--\\n\\n“Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and\\nhomeless?”\\n\\nThere was no response. \\xa0The old man bent down and scanned the boy’s\\nreposeful face and listened to his placid breathing.  “He sleeps--sleeps\\nsoundly;” and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of\\nevil satisfaction. \\xa0A smile flitted across the dreaming boy’s features.\\nThe hermit muttered, “So--his heart is happy;” and he turned away. \\xa0He\\nwent stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;\\nnow and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around\\nand casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always\\nmumbling to himself. \\xa0At last he found what he seemed to want--a rusty\\nold butcher knife and a whetstone. \\xa0Then he crept to his place by the\\nfire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone,\\nstill muttering, mumbling, ejaculating. \\xa0The winds sighed around the\\nlonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the\\ndistances. \\xa0The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at\\nthe old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt,\\nabsorbed, and noted none of these things.\\n\\nAt long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and\\nnodded his head with satisfaction.  “It grows sharper,” he said; “yes,\\nit grows sharper.”\\n\\nHe took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,\\nentertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in\\narticulate speech--\\n\\n“His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us--and is gone down into the\\neternal fires! \\xa0Yes, down into the eternal fires! \\xa0He escaped us--but it\\nwas God’s will, yes it was God’s will, we must not repine. \\xa0But he\\nhath not escaped the fires! \\xa0No, he hath not escaped the fires, the\\nconsuming, unpitying, remorseless fires--and _they_ are everlasting!”\\n\\nAnd so he wrought, and still wrought--mumbling, chuckling a low rasping\\nchuckle at times--and at times breaking again into words--\\n\\n“It was his father that did it all. \\xa0I am but an archangel; but for him\\nI should be pope!”\\n\\nThe King stirred. \\xa0The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and\\nwent down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife\\nuplifted. \\xa0The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but\\nthere was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his\\ntranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.\\n\\nThe hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and\\nscarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept\\naway, saying,--\\n\\n“It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest\\nby accident someone be passing.”\\n\\nHe glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and\\nanother one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling\\nhe managed to tie the King’s ankles together without waking him. \\xa0Next\\nhe essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them,\\nbut the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was\\nready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready\\nto despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment\\nthey were bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper’s chin and\\nbrought up over his head and tied fast--and so softly, so gradually,\\nand so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy\\nslept peacefully through it all without stirring.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI. Hendon to the rescue.\\n\\nThe old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the\\nlow bench. \\xa0He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and\\nflickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving\\neyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there,\\nheedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled\\nand chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as\\na grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay\\nbound and helpless in his web.\\n\\nAfter a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,--yet not seeing,\\nhis mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,--observed, on a\\nsudden, that the boy’s eyes were open! wide open and staring!--staring\\nup in frozen horror at the knife. \\xa0The smile of a gratified devil crept\\nover the old man’s face, and he said, without changing his attitude or\\nhis occupation--\\n\\n“Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?”\\n\\nThe boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced\\na smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to\\ninterpret as an affirmative answer to his question.\\n\\n“Then pray again. \\xa0Pray the prayer for the dying!”\\n\\nA shudder shook the boy’s frame, and his face blenched. \\xa0Then he\\nstruggled again to free himself--turning and twisting himself this way\\nand that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately--but uselessly--to\\nburst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him,\\nand nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time\\nto time, “The moments are precious, they are few and precious--pray the\\nprayer for the dying!”\\n\\nThe boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles,\\npanting. \\xa0The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down\\nhis face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the\\nsavage old man.\\n\\nThe dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply,\\nwith a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice--\\n\\n“I may not indulge this ecstasy longer! \\xa0The night is already gone. \\xa0It\\nseems but a moment--only a moment; would it had endured a year! \\xa0Seed of\\nthe Church’s spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an’ thou fearest to look\\nupon--”\\n\\nThe rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings. \\xa0The old man sank upon his\\nknees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.\\n\\nHark! \\xa0There was a sound of voices near the cabin--the knife dropped\\nfrom the hermit’s hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up,\\ntrembling. \\xa0The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough\\nand angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift\\nfootsteps, retreating. \\xa0Immediately came a succession of thundering\\nknocks upon the cabin door, followed by--\\n\\n“Hullo-o-o! \\xa0Open! \\xa0And despatch, in the name of all the devils!”\\n\\nOh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King’s\\nears; for it was Miles Hendon’s voice!\\n\\nThe hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of\\nthe bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King\\nheard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the ‘chapel’:--\\n\\n“Homage and greeting, reverend sir! \\xa0Where is the boy--_my_ boy?”\\n\\n“What boy, friend?”\\n\\n“What boy! \\xa0Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I am not\\nin the humour for it. \\xa0Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I\\njudged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was\\nat large again, and they had tracked him to your door. \\xa0They showed me\\nhis very footprints. \\xa0Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an’\\nthou produce him not--Where is the boy?”\\n\\n“O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried\\nhere the night. \\xa0If such as you take an interest in such as he, know,\\nthen, that I have sent him of an errand. \\xa0He will be back anon.”\\n\\n“How soon? \\xa0How soon? \\xa0Come, waste not the time--cannot I overtake him?\\nHow soon will he be back?”\\n\\n“Thou need’st not stir; he will return quickly.”\\n\\n“So be it, then. \\xa0I will try to wait. \\xa0But stop!--_you_ sent him of an\\nerrand?--you! \\xa0Verily this is a lie--he would not go. \\xa0He would pull thy\\nold beard, an’ thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied,\\nfriend; thou hast surely lied! \\xa0He would not go for thee, nor for any\\nman.”\\n\\n“For any _man_--no; haply not. \\xa0But I am not a man.”\\n\\n“_What_! \\xa0Now o’ God’s name what art thou, then?”\\n\\n“It is a secret--mark thou reveal it not. \\xa0I am an archangel!”\\n\\nThere was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon--not altogether\\nunprofane--followed by--\\n\\n“This doth well and truly account for his complaisance! \\xa0Right well\\nI knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any\\nmortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the\\nword o’ command! \\xa0Let me--‘sh! \\xa0What noise was that?”\\n\\nAll this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with\\nterror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown\\nall the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly\\nexpecting them to reach Hendon’s ear, but always realising, with\\nbitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression. \\xa0So this\\nlast remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh\\nfields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his\\nenergy, just as the hermit was saying--\\n\\n“Noise? \\xa0I heard only the wind.”\\n\\n“Mayhap it was. \\xa0Yes, doubtless that was it. \\xa0I have been hearing it\\nfaintly all the--there it is again! \\xa0It is not the wind! \\xa0What an odd\\nsound! \\xa0Come, we will hunt it out!”\\n\\nNow the King’s joy was nearly insupportable. \\xa0His tired lungs did\\ntheir utmost--and hopefully, too--but the sealed jaws and the muffling\\nsheepskin sadly crippled the effort. \\xa0Then the poor fellow’s heart sank,\\nto hear the hermit say--\\n\\n“Ah, it came from without--I think from the copse yonder. \\xa0Come, I will\\nlead the way.”\\n\\nThe King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die\\nquickly away--then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.\\n\\nIt seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching\\nagain--and this time he heard an added sound,--the trampling of hoofs,\\napparently. \\xa0Then he heard Hendon say--\\n\\n“I will not wait longer. \\xa0I _cannot_ wait longer. \\xa0He has lost his way\\nin this thick wood. \\xa0Which direction took he? \\xa0Quick--point it out to\\nme.”\\n\\n“He--but wait; I will go with thee.”\\n\\n“Good--good! \\xa0Why, truly thou art better than thy looks. \\xa0Marry I do\\nnot think there’s not another archangel with so right a heart as thine.\\n\\xa0Wilt ride? \\xa0Wilt take the wee donkey that’s for my boy, or wilt thou\\nfork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have\\nprovided for myself?--and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the\\nindifferent sum of a month’s usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker\\nout of work.”\\n\\n“No--ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and\\nwill walk.”\\n\\n“Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my\\nhands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one.”\\n\\nThen followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings,\\naccompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and\\nfinally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its\\nspirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment.\\n\\nWith unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and\\nfootsteps fade away and die out. \\xa0All hope forsook him, now, for the\\nmoment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart. “My only friend\\nis deceived and got rid of,” he said; “the hermit will return and--” \\xa0He\\nfinished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with\\nhis bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin.\\n\\nAnd now he heard the door open! \\xa0The sound chilled him to the\\nmarrow--already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat. \\xa0Horror made\\nhim close his eyes; horror made him open them again--and before him\\nstood John Canty and Hugo!\\n\\nHe would have said “Thank God!” if his jaws had been free.\\n\\nA moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each\\ngripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the\\nforest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII. A Victim of Treachery.\\n\\nOnce more ‘King Foo-foo the First’ was roving with the tramps and\\noutlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and\\nsometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and\\nHugo when the Ruffler’s back was turned. \\xa0None but Canty and Hugo really\\ndisliked him. \\xa0Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck\\nand spirit. \\xa0During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge\\nthe King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable;\\nand at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by\\nputting small indignities upon him--always as if by accident. \\xa0Twice he\\nstepped upon the King’s toes--accidentally--and the King, as became his\\nroyalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but\\nthe third time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled\\nhim to the ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe.\\n\\xa0Hugo, consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and\\ncame at his small adversary in a fury. \\xa0Instantly a ring was formed\\naround the gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.\\n\\nBut poor Hugo stood no chance whatever. \\xa0His frantic and lubberly\\n‘prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against\\nan arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in\\nsingle-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick of swordsmanship.\\n\\xa0The little King stood, alert but at graceful ease, and caught and\\nturned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which\\nset the motley on-lookers wild with admiration; and every now and then,\\nwhen his practised eye detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap\\nupon Hugo’s head followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter\\nthat swept the place was something wonderful to hear. \\xa0At the end of\\nfifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for\\na pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the\\nunscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the\\nshoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the\\nRuffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks;\\nhis meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled,\\nand a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who\\nshould thenceforth utter it.\\n\\nAll attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed. He\\nhad stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape.\\n\\xa0He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his\\nreturn; he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the\\nhousemates. He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work;\\nhe would not work; moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own\\nsoldering-iron; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their\\nhands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away. \\xa0He\\ndelivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered\\nhis liberties or tried to force him to service. \\xa0He was sent out, in\\nHugo’s charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby,\\nto beg; but the result was not encouraging--he declined to plead for the\\nmendicants, or be a party to their cause in any way.\\n\\nThus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and\\nthe weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became\\ngradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at\\nlast to feel that his release from the hermit’s knife must prove only a\\ntemporary respite from death, at best.\\n\\nBut at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was\\non his throne, and master again. \\xa0This, of course, intensified the\\nsufferings of the awakening--so the mortifications of each succeeding\\nmorning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the\\ncombat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to\\nbear.\\n\\nThe morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with\\nvengeful purposes against the King. \\xa0He had two plans, in particular.\\nOne was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit\\nand ‘imagined’ royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to\\naccomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the\\nKing, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law.\\n\\nIn pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a ‘clime’ upon the\\nKing’s leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and\\nperfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get\\nCanty’s help, and _force_ the King to expose his leg in the highway\\nand beg for alms.  ‘Clime’ was the cant term for a sore, artificially\\ncreated. To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of\\nunslaked lime, soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a\\npiece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg. \\xa0This would\\npresently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking;\\nblood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a\\ndark and repulsive colour. \\xa0Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in\\na cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen,\\nand move the compassion of the passer-by. {8}\\n\\nHugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the\\nsoldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon\\nas they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker\\nheld him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg.\\n\\nThe King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the\\nsceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him\\nand enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats. \\xa0This\\ncontinued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work\\nwould have been perfected, if there had been no interruption. \\xa0But there\\nwas; for about this time the ‘slave’ who had made the speech denouncing\\nEngland’s laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise,\\nand stripped off the poultice and bandage.\\n\\nThe King wanted to borrow his deliverer’s cudgel and warm the jackets\\nof the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring\\ntrouble--leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together,\\nthen, the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt. \\xa0He\\nmarched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler,\\nwho listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be\\nagain detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something\\nhigher and better--wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the\\nmendicant rank and appointed him to steal!\\n\\nHugo was overjoyed. \\xa0He had already tried to make the King steal, and\\nfailed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of\\ncourse the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered\\ndirectly from head-quarters. \\xa0So he planned a raid for that very\\nafternoon, purposing to get the King in the law’s grip in the course of\\nit; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem\\nto be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was\\npopular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular\\nmember who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him\\nover to the common enemy, the law.\\n\\nVery well. \\xa0All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village\\nwith his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after\\nanother, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil\\npurpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and\\nget free of his infamous captivity for ever.\\n\\nBoth threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both,\\nin their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this\\ntime, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into\\nany venture that had much uncertainty about it.\\n\\nHugo’s chance came first. \\xa0For at last a woman approached who carried a\\nfat package of some sort in a basket. \\xa0Hugo’s eyes sparkled with sinful\\npleasure as he said to himself, “Breath o’ my life, an’ I can but\\nput _that_ upon him, ’tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the\\nGame-Cocks!” He waited and watched--outwardly patient, but inwardly\\nconsuming with excitement--till the woman had passed by, and the time\\nwas ripe; then said, in a low voice--\\n\\n“Tarry here till I come again,” and darted stealthily after the prey.\\n\\nThe King’s heart was filled with joy--he could make his escape, now, if\\nHugo’s quest only carried him far enough away.\\n\\nBut he was to have no such luck. \\xa0Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched\\nthe package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of\\nblanket which he carried on his arm. \\xa0The hue and cry was raised in a\\nmoment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden,\\nalthough she had not seen the pilfering done. \\xa0Hugo thrust the bundle\\ninto the King’s hands without halting, saying--\\n\\n“Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry ‘Stop thief!’ but mind ye\\nlead them astray!”\\n\\nThe next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked\\nalley--and in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking\\ninnocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch\\nresults.\\n\\nThe insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell\\naway from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her\\nheels; she seized the King’s wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle\\nwith the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy\\nwhile he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip.\\n\\nHugo had seen enough--his enemy was captured and the law would get him,\\nnow--so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards,\\nframing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler’s crew\\nas he strode along.\\n\\nThe King continued to struggle in the woman’s strong grasp, and now and\\nthen cried out in vexation--\\n\\n“Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of\\nthy paltry goods.”\\n\\nThe crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a\\nbrawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows,\\nmade a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson;\\nbut just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing\\nforce upon the man’s arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it\\nremarking pleasantly, at the same time--\\n\\n“Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and\\nuncharitable words. \\xa0This is matter for the law’s consideration,\\nnot private and unofficial handling. \\xa0Loose thy hold from the boy,\\ngoodwife.”\\n\\nThe blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went\\nmuttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy’s wrist\\nreluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently\\nclosed their mouths. \\xa0The King sprang to his deliverer’s side, with\\nflushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming--\\n\\n“Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir\\nMiles; carve me this rabble to rags!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.\\n\\nHendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King’s\\near--\\n\\n“Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily--nay, suffer it not to\\nwag at all. \\xa0Trust in me--all shall go well in the end.” Then he added\\nto himself:  “_Sir_ Miles! \\xa0Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a\\nknight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth\\ntake upon his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title\\nis mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is\\nmore honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of\\nDreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of\\nthe _real_ kingdoms of this world.”\\n\\nThe crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about\\nto lay his hand upon the King’s shoulder, when Hendon said--\\n\\n“Gently, good friend, withhold your hand--he shall go peaceably; I am\\nresponsible for that. \\xa0Lead on, we will follow.”\\n\\nThe officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King\\nfollowed after, with the crowd at their heels. \\xa0The King was inclined to\\nrebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice--\\n\\n“Reflect, Sire--your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty;\\nshall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect\\nthem? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on\\nhis throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was\\nseemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and\\nsubmitted to its authority?”\\n\\n“Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King\\nof England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself\\nsuffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.”\\n\\nWhen the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the\\npeace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who\\nhad committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so\\nthe King stood convicted. \\xa0The bundle was now unrolled, and when the\\ncontents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked\\ntroubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an\\nelectric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected\\nby his ignorance. \\xa0The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then\\nturned to the woman, with the question--\\n\\n“What dost thou hold this property to be worth?”\\n\\nThe woman courtesied and replied--\\n\\n“Three shillings and eightpence, your worship--I could not abate a penny\\nand set forth the value honestly.”\\n\\nThe justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to\\nthe constable, and said--\\n\\n“Clear the court and close the doors.”\\n\\nIt was done. \\xa0None remained but the two officials, the accused, the\\naccuser, and Miles Hendon. \\xa0This latter was rigid and colourless, and\\non his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended\\ntogether, and trickled down his face. \\xa0The judge turned to the woman\\nagain, and said, in a compassionate voice--\\n\\n“‘Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for\\nthese be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an\\nevil face--but when hunger driveth--Good woman! dost know that when one\\nsteals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha’penny the law saith\\nhe shall _hang_ for it?”\\n\\nThe little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled\\nhimself and held his peace; but not so the woman. \\xa0She sprang to her\\nfeet, shaking with fright, and cried out--\\n\\n“Oh, good lack, what have I done! \\xa0God-a-mercy, I would not hang\\nthe poor thing for the whole world! \\xa0Ah, save me from this, your\\nworship--what shall I do, what _can_ I do?”\\n\\nThe justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said--\\n\\n“Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ\\nupon the record.”\\n\\n“Then in God’s name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day\\nthat freed my conscience of this awesome thing!”\\n\\nMiles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King\\nand wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging\\nhim. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig;\\nand when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into\\nthe narrow hall. \\xa0The justice proceeded to write in his record book.\\n\\xa0Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer\\nfollowed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and\\nlistened. \\xa0He heard a conversation to this effect--\\n\\n“It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here\\nis the eightpence.”\\n\\n“Eightpence, indeed! \\xa0Thou’lt do no such thing. \\xa0It cost me three\\nshillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old\\nHarry that’s just dead ne’er touched or tampered with. \\xa0A fig for thy\\neightpence!”\\n\\n“Stands the wind in that quarter? \\xa0Thou wast under oath, and so swore\\nfalsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence. \\xa0Come straightway\\nback with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!--and then the\\nlad will hang.”\\n\\n“There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. \\xa0Give me the\\neightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.”\\n\\nThe woman went off crying: \\xa0Hendon slipped back into the court room,\\nand the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some\\nconvenient place. \\xa0The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King\\na wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment\\nin the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging. \\xa0The astounded\\nKing opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to\\nbe beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and\\nsucceeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.\\nHendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the\\ntwo departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. \\xa0The moment\\nthe street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his\\nhand, and exclaimed--\\n\\n“Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail _alive_?”\\n\\nHendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply--\\n\\n“_Will_ you trust in me? \\xa0Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with\\ndangerous speech. \\xa0What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it,\\nthou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient--‘twill be time\\nenow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.” {1}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV. The Escape.\\n\\nThe short winter day was nearly ended. \\xa0The streets were deserted, save\\nfor a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the\\nintent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands\\nas quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising\\nwind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to\\nthe left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem\\nto see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his\\nway to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.\\nBy-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and\\nproceeded to cross it. \\xa0When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon\\nlaid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice--\\n\\n“Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a\\nword to thee.”\\n\\n“My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.”\\n\\n“Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly. \\xa0Turn thy back\\na moment and seem not to see: \\xa0_let this poor lad escape_.”\\n\\n“This to me, sir! \\xa0I arrest thee in--”\\n\\n“Nay, be not too hasty. \\xa0See thou be careful and commit no foolish\\nerror,”--then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man’s\\near--“the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck,\\nman!”\\n\\nThe poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then\\nfound his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon\\nwas tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee\\ncome to harm. \\xa0Observe, I heard it all--every word. \\xa0I will prove it to\\nthee.” Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman\\nhad had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--\\n\\n“There--have I set it forth correctly? \\xa0Should not I be able to set it\\nforth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?”\\n\\nThe man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied,\\nand said with forced lightness--\\n\\n“‘Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the\\nwoman for mine amusement.”\\n\\n“Kept you the woman’s pig for amusement?”\\n\\nThe man answered sharply--\\n\\n“Nought else, good sir--I tell thee ’twas but a jest.”\\n\\n“I do begin to believe thee,” said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of\\nmockery and half-conviction in his tone; “but tarry thou here a\\nmoment whilst I run and ask his worship--for nathless, he being a man\\nexperienced in law, in jests, in--”\\n\\nHe was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted,\\nspat out an oath or two, then cried out--\\n\\n“Hold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge! \\xa0Why, man, he\\nhath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we\\nwill speak further. \\xa0Ods body! \\xa0I seem to be in evil case--and all for\\nan innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my\\nwife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst\\nthou of me?”\\n\\n“Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a\\nhundred thousand--counting slowly,” said Hendon, with the expression of\\na man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.\\n\\n“It is my destruction!” said the constable despairingly.  “Ah, be\\nreasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and\\nsee how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how plainly it is so. \\xa0And\\neven if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that\\ne’en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and\\nwarning from the judge’s lips.”\\n\\nHendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--\\n\\n“This jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?”\\n\\n“I knew it not! \\xa0Peradventure I have been unwise. \\xa0I never dreamed it\\nhad a name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.”\\n\\n“Yes, it hath a name. \\xa0In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis\\nlex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.”\\n\\n“Ah, my God!”\\n\\n“And the penalty is death!”\\n\\n“God be merciful to me a sinner!”\\n\\n“By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy,\\nthou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha’penny, paying but\\na trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive\\nbarratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem\\nexpurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without\\nransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.”\\n\\n“Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! \\xa0Be thou\\nmerciful--spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought\\nthat shall happen.”\\n\\n“Good! now thou’rt wise and reasonable. \\xa0And thou’lt restore the pig?”\\n\\n“I will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it\\nand an archangel fetch it. \\xa0Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.\\n\\xa0I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by\\nforce. \\xa0It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down myself\\nbetwixt midnight and the morning.”\\n\\n“Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving\\ncharity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer’s\\nbones for his escape.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV. Hendon Hall.\\n\\nAs soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his\\nMajesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and\\nwait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.\\nHalf an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on\\nHendon’s sorry steeds. \\xa0The King was warm and comfortable, now, for\\nhe had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which\\nHendon had bought on London Bridge.\\n\\nHendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that\\nhard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be\\nbad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise\\nwould be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken\\nintellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the\\ntormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages\\ntoward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying\\nthe impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.\\n\\nWhen he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a\\nconsiderable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn.\\n\\xa0The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King’s\\nchair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was\\nready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept\\nathwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.\\n\\nThe next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking\\nover the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily\\nenjoying each other’s narratives. \\xa0Hendon detailed all his wide\\nwanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had\\nled him a fool’s journey all over the forest, and taken him back to\\nthe hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him. \\xa0Then--he\\nsaid--the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back\\nlooking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy\\nhad returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so. \\xa0Hendon\\nhad waited at the hut all day; hope of the King’s return died out, then,\\nand he departed upon the quest again.\\n\\n“And old Sanctum Sanctorum _was_ truly sorry your highness came not\\nback,” said Hendon; “I saw it in his face.”\\n\\n“Marry I will never doubt _that_!” said the King--and then told his own\\nstory; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.\\n\\nDuring the last day of the trip, Hendon’s spirits were soaring. His\\ntongue ran constantly. \\xa0He talked about his old father, and his brother\\nArthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and\\ngenerous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith,\\nand was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and\\nbrotherly things about Hugh. \\xa0He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting\\nat Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an\\noutburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.\\n\\nIt was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road\\nled through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with\\ngentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding\\nundulations of the sea. \\xa0In the afternoon the returning prodigal made\\nconstant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock\\nhe might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home. \\xa0At\\nlast he was successful, and cried out excitedly--\\n\\n“There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You\\nmay see the towers from here; and that wood there--that is my father’s\\npark. Ah, _now_ thou’lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with\\nseventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants! \\xa0A brave\\nlodging for such as we, is it not so? \\xa0Come, let us speed--my impatience\\nwill not brook further delay.”\\n\\nAll possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o’clock before\\nthe village was reached. \\xa0The travellers scampered through it, Hendon’s\\ntongue going all the time.  “Here is the church--covered with the same\\nivy--none gone, none added.”  “Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and\\nyonder is the market-place.”  “Here is the Maypole, and here the\\npump--nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years\\nmake a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know\\nme.” \\xa0So his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then\\nthe travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall\\nhedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a\\nvast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars\\nbore sculptured armorial devices. \\xa0A noble mansion was before them.\\n\\n“Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!” exclaimed Miles.  “Ah, ’tis a great\\nday! \\xa0My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with\\njoy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first\\ntransports of the meeting, and so thou’lt seem but coldly welcomed--but\\nmind it not; ’twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my\\nward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou’lt see them\\ntake thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon’s sake, and make their house\\nand hearts thy home for ever after!”\\n\\nThe next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door,\\nhelped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few\\nsteps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King\\nwith more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a\\nwriting-table in front of a generous fire of logs.\\n\\n“Embrace me, Hugh,” he cried, “and say thou’rt glad I am come again! and\\ncall our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and\\nsee his face, and hear his voice once more!”\\n\\nBut Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent\\na grave stare upon the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of\\noffended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward\\nthought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with\\na real or assumed compassion. \\xa0Presently he said, in a mild voice--\\n\\n“Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered\\nprivations and rude buffetings at the world’s hands; thy looks and dress\\nbetoken it. \\xa0Whom dost thou take me to be?”\\n\\n“Take thee? \\xa0Prithee for whom else than whom thou art? \\xa0I take thee to\\nbe Hugh Hendon,” said Miles, sharply.\\n\\nThe other continued, in the same soft tone--\\n\\n“And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?”\\n\\n“Imagination hath nought to do with it! \\xa0Dost thou pretend thou knowest\\nme not for thy brother Miles Hendon?”\\n\\nAn expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh’s face, and he\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n“What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life? \\xa0God be praised\\nif it be so! \\xa0Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these\\ncruel years! \\xa0Ah, it seems too good to be true, it _is_ too good to be\\ntrue--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me! \\xa0Quick--come to\\nthe light--let me scan thee well!”\\n\\nHe seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to\\ndevour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and\\nthat, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him\\nfrom all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with\\ngladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--\\n\\n“Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou’lt find nor limb nor feature\\nthat cannot bide the test. \\xa0Scour and scan me to thy content, my good\\nold Hugh--I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost\\nbrother, is’t not so? \\xa0Ah, ’tis a great day--I _said_ ’twas a great day!\\n\\xa0Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek--lord, I am like to die of very\\njoy!”\\n\\nHe was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand\\nin dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying\\nwith emotion--\\n\\n“Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous\\ndisappointment!”\\n\\nMiles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue,\\nand cried out--\\n\\n“_What_ disappointment? \\xa0Am I not thy brother?”\\n\\nHugh shook his head sadly, and said--\\n\\n“I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the\\nresemblances that are hid from mine. \\xa0Alack, I fear me the letter spoke\\nbut too truly.”\\n\\n“What letter?”\\n\\n“One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago. \\xa0It said my\\nbrother died in battle.”\\n\\n“It was a lie! \\xa0Call thy father--he will know me.”\\n\\n“One may not call the dead.”\\n\\n“Dead?” Miles’s voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.  “My father\\ndead!--oh, this is heavy news. \\xa0Half my new joy is withered now.\\n\\xa0Prithee let me see my brother Arthur--he will know me; he will know me\\nand console me.”\\n\\n“He, also, is dead.”\\n\\n“God be merciful to me, a stricken man! \\xa0Gone,--both gone--the worthy\\ntaken and the worthless spared, in me! \\xa0Ah! I crave your mercy!--do not\\nsay the Lady Edith--”\\n\\n“Is dead? \\xa0No, she lives.”\\n\\n“Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again! \\xa0Speed thee, brother--let\\nher come to me! \\xa0An’ _she_ say I am not myself--but she will not; no,\\nno, _she_ will know me, I were a fool to doubt it. Bring her--bring the\\nold servants; they, too, will know me.”\\n\\n“All are gone but five--Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret.”\\n\\nSo saying, Hugh left the room. \\xa0Miles stood musing a while, then began\\nto walk the floor, muttering--\\n\\n“The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and\\nhonest--‘tis an odd thing.”\\n\\nHe continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had\\nforgotten the King entirely. \\xa0By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and\\nwith a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were\\ncapable of being interpreted ironically--\\n\\n“Mind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose\\nidentity is denied, and whose claims are derided. \\xa0Thou hast company.”\\n\\n“Ah, my King,” cried Hendon, colouring slightly, “do not thou condemn\\nme--wait, and thou shalt see. \\xa0I am no impostor--she will say it; you\\nshall hear it from the sweetest lips in England. \\xa0I an impostor? \\xa0Why, I\\nknow this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things\\nthat are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery. \\xa0Here was I born\\nand bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and\\nshould none else believe, I pray thee do not _thou_ doubt me--I could\\nnot bear it.”\\n\\n“I do not doubt thee,” said the King, with a childlike simplicity and\\nfaith.\\n\\n“I thank thee out of my heart!” exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which\\nshowed that he was touched. \\xa0The King added, with the same gentle\\nsimplicity--\\n\\n“Dost thou doubt _me_?”\\n\\nA guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door\\nopened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of\\nreplying.\\n\\nA beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came\\nseveral liveried servants. \\xa0The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed\\nand her eyes fixed upon the floor. \\xa0The face was unspeakably sad. \\xa0Miles\\nHendon sprang forward, crying out--\\n\\n“Oh, my Edith, my darling--”\\n\\nBut Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady--\\n\\n“Look upon him. \\xa0Do you know him?”\\n\\nAt the sound of Miles’s voice the woman had started slightly, and her\\ncheeks had flushed; she was trembling now. \\xa0She stood still, during an\\nimpressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and\\nlooked into Hendon’s eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood\\nsank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey\\npallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, “I know\\nhim not!” and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of\\nthe room.\\n\\nMiles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.\\nAfter a pause, his brother said to the servants--\\n\\n“You have observed him. \\xa0Do you know him?”\\n\\nThey shook their heads; then the master said--\\n\\n“The servants know you not, sir. \\xa0I fear there is some mistake. You have\\nseen that my wife knew you not.”\\n\\n“Thy _wife_!” \\xa0In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron\\ngrip about his throat.  “Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!\\n\\xa0Thou’st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods\\nare its fruit. \\xa0There--now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable\\nsoldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!”\\n\\nHugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and\\ncommanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger. \\xa0They\\nhesitated, and one of them said--\\n\\n“He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless.”\\n\\n“Armed! \\xa0What of it, and ye so many? \\xa0Upon him, I say!”\\n\\nBut Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added--\\n\\n“Ye know me of old--I have not changed; come on, an’ it like you.”\\n\\nThis reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.\\n\\n“Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors,\\nwhilst I send one to fetch the watch!” said Hugh. \\xa0He turned at the\\nthreshold, and said to Miles, “You’ll find it to your advantage to\\noffend not with useless endeavours at escape.”\\n\\n“Escape? \\xa0Spare thyself discomfort, an’ that is all that troubles thee.\\nFor Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings. \\xa0He\\nwill remain--doubt it not.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI. Disowned.\\n\\nThe King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said--\\n\\n“‘Tis strange--most strange. \\xa0I cannot account for it.”\\n\\n“No, it is not strange, my liege. \\xa0I know him, and this conduct is but\\nnatural. \\xa0He was a rascal from his birth.”\\n\\n“Oh, I spake not of _him_, Sir Miles.”\\n\\n“Not of him? \\xa0Then of what? \\xa0What is it that is strange?”\\n\\n“That the King is not missed.”\\n\\n“How? \\xa0Which? \\xa0I doubt I do not understand.”\\n\\n“Indeed? \\xa0Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land\\nis not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and\\nmaking search for me? \\xa0Is it no matter for commotion and distress that\\nthe Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?”\\n\\n“Most true, my King, I had forgot.” \\xa0Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to\\nhimself, “Poor ruined mind--still busy with its pathetic dream.”\\n\\n“But I have a plan that shall right us both--I will write a paper, in\\nthree tongues--Latin, Greek and English--and thou shalt haste away with\\nit to London in the morning. \\xa0Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord\\nHertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it. \\xa0Then\\nhe will send for me.”\\n\\n“Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself\\nand make my rights secure to my domains? \\xa0I should be so much the better\\nable then to--”\\n\\nThe King interrupted him imperiously--\\n\\n“Peace! \\xa0What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted\\nwith matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a\\nthrone?” \\xa0Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his\\nseverity, “Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee\\nwhole--yes, more than whole. \\xa0I shall remember, and requite.”\\n\\nSo saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work. \\xa0Hendon\\ncontemplated him lovingly a while, then said to himself--\\n\\n“An’ it were dark, I should think it _was_ a king that spoke; there’s\\nno denying it, when the humour’s upon on him he doth thunder and lighten\\nlike your true King; now where got he that trick? \\xa0See him scribble and\\nscratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to\\nbe Latin and Greek--and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device\\nfor diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post\\naway to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me.”\\n\\nThe next moment Sir Miles’s thoughts had gone back to the recent\\nepisode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently\\nhanded him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and\\npocketed it without being conscious of the act. “How marvellous strange\\nshe acted,” he muttered.  “I think she knew me--and I think she did\\n_not_ know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I\\ncannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the\\ntwo, or even persuade one to outweigh the other. \\xa0The matter standeth\\nsimply thus: she _must_ have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how\\ncould it be otherwise? \\xa0Yet she __said_ _she knew me not, and that is\\nproof perfect, for she cannot lie. \\xa0But stop--I think I begin to see.\\nPeradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to\\nlie. \\xa0That is the solution. \\xa0The riddle is unriddled. \\xa0She seemed dead\\nwith fear--yes, she was under his compulsion. \\xa0I will seek her; I will\\nfind her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind. \\xa0She will\\nremember the old times when we were little playfellows together, and\\nthis will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will\\nconfess me. \\xa0There is no treacherous blood in her--no, she was always\\nhonest and true. \\xa0She has loved me, in those old days--this is my\\nsecurity; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray.”\\n\\nHe stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the\\nLady Edith entered. \\xa0She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step,\\nand her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity. Her face was as\\nsad as before.\\n\\nMiles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she\\nchecked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he\\nwas. \\xa0She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise. Thus simply did\\nshe take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him\\ninto a stranger and a guest. \\xa0The surprise of it, the bewildering\\nunexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he\\n_was_ the person he was pretending to be, after all. \\xa0The Lady Edith\\nsaid--\\n\\n“Sir, I have come to warn you. \\xa0The mad cannot be persuaded out of\\ntheir delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid\\nperils. \\xa0I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to\\nyou, and therefore is not criminal--but do not tarry here with it; for\\nhere it is dangerous.” \\xa0She looked steadily into Miles’s face a moment,\\nthen added, impressively, “It is the more dangerous for that you _are_\\nmuch like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived.”\\n\\n“Heavens, madam, but I _am_ he!”\\n\\n“I truly think you think it, sir. \\xa0I question not your honesty in that;\\nI but warn you, that is all. \\xa0My husband is master in this region; his\\npower hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.\\nIf you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might\\nbid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know\\nhim well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a\\nmad impostor, and straightway all will echo him.” \\xa0She bent upon Miles\\nthat same steady look once more, and added:  “If you _were_ Miles\\nHendon, and he knew it and all the region knew it--consider what I\\nam saying, weigh it well--you would stand in the same peril, your\\npunishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce you,\\nand none would be bold enough to give you countenance.”\\n\\n“Most truly I believe it,” said Miles, bitterly.  “The power that\\ncan command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be\\nobeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are\\non the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned.”\\n\\nA faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady’s cheek, and she dropped\\nher eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she\\nproceeded--\\n\\n“I have warned you--I must still warn you--to go hence. \\xa0This man will\\ndestroy you, else. \\xa0He is a tyrant who knows no pity. \\xa0I, who am\\nhis fettered slave, know this. \\xa0Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear\\nguardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest: \\xa0better that\\nyou were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this\\nmiscreant. \\xa0Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions;\\nyou have assaulted him in his own house: \\xa0you are ruined if you stay.\\n\\xa0Go--do not hesitate. If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you,\\nand bribe the servants to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and\\nescape while you may.”\\n\\nMiles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before\\nher.\\n\\n“Grant me one thing,” he said.  “Let your eyes rest upon mine, so that I\\nmay see if they be steady. \\xa0There--now answer me. \\xa0Am I Miles Hendon?”\\n\\n“No. \\xa0I know you not.”\\n\\n“Swear it!”\\n\\nThe answer was low, but distinct--\\n\\n“I swear.”\\n\\n“Oh, this passes belief!”\\n\\n“Fly! \\xa0Why will you waste the precious time? \\xa0Fly, and save yourself.”\\n\\nAt that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle\\nbegan; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away. The King was\\ntaken also, and both were bound and led to prison.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII. In Prison.\\n\\nThe cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large\\nroom where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.\\nThey had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered\\nprisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,--an obscene and noisy\\ngang. \\xa0The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put\\nupon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn. \\xa0He was pretty\\nthoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting\\nto find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the\\ncold shoulder and a jail. \\xa0The promise and the fulfilment differed so\\nwidely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it\\nwas most tragic or most grotesque. \\xa0He felt much as a man might who had\\ndanced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning.\\n\\nBut gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into\\nsome sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith. \\xa0He\\nturned her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not\\nmake anything satisfactory out of it. \\xa0Did she know him--or didn’t she\\nknow him? \\xa0It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but\\nhe ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had\\nrepudiated him for interested reasons. \\xa0He wanted to load her name with\\ncurses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found\\nhe could not bring his tongue to profane it.\\n\\nWrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon\\nand the King passed a troubled night. \\xa0For a bribe the jailer had\\nfurnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs,\\nfighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence. \\xa0At last,\\na while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by\\nbeating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could\\ncome to the rescue. \\xa0The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound\\nclubbing about the head and shoulders--then the carousing ceased;\\nand after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the\\nannoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.\\n\\nDuring the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous\\nsameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less\\ndistinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the ‘impostor’ and repudiate\\nand insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with\\nsymmetrical regularity. \\xa0However, there was a change of incident at\\nlast. The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him--\\n\\n“The villain is in this room--cast thy old eyes about and see if thou\\ncanst say which is he.”\\n\\nHendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first\\ntime since he had been in the jail. \\xa0He said to himself, “This is Blake\\nAndrews, a servant all his life in my father’s family--a good honest\\nsoul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly. \\xa0But none are\\ntrue now; all are liars. \\xa0This man will know me--and will deny me, too,\\nlike the rest.”\\n\\nThe old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and\\nfinally said--\\n\\n“I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o’ the streets. \\xa0Which is he?”\\n\\nThe jailer laughed.\\n\\n“Here,” he said; “scan this big animal, and grant me an opinion.”\\n\\nThe old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then\\nshook his head and said--\\n\\n“Marry, _this_ is no Hendon--nor ever was!”\\n\\n“Right! \\xa0Thy old eyes are sound yet. \\xa0An’ I were Sir Hugh, I would take\\nthe shabby carle and--”\\n\\nThe jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary\\nhalter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat\\nsuggestive of suffocation. \\xa0The old man said, vindictively--\\n\\n“Let him bless God an’ he fare no worse. \\xa0An’ _I_ had the handling o’\\nthe villain he should roast, or I am no true man!”\\n\\nThe jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said--\\n\\n“Give him a piece of thy mind, old man--they all do it. \\xa0Thou’lt find it\\ngood diversion.”\\n\\nThen he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared. \\xa0The old man\\ndropped upon his knees and whispered--\\n\\n“God be thanked, thou’rt come again, my master! \\xa0I believed thou wert\\ndead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive! \\xa0I knew thee the\\nmoment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance\\nand seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o’ the\\nstreets. I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go\\nforth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it.”\\n\\n“No,” said Hendon; “thou shalt not. \\xa0It would ruin thee, and yet help\\nbut little in my cause. \\xa0But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back\\nsomewhat of my lost faith in my kind.”\\n\\nThe old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for\\nhe dropped in several times a day to ‘abuse’ the former, and always\\nsmuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he\\nalso furnished the current news. \\xa0Hendon reserved the dainties for the\\nKing; without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was\\nnot able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer.\\n\\xa0Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to\\navoid suspicion; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information\\neach time--information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon’s benefit,\\nand interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for\\nthe benefit of other hearers.\\n\\nSo, little by little, the story of the family came out. \\xa0Arthur had\\nbeen dead six years. \\xa0This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon,\\nimpaired the father’s health; he believed he was going to die, and he\\nwished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but\\nEdith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles’s return; then the letter\\ncame which brought the news of Miles’s death; the shock prostrated Sir\\nRichard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted\\nupon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month’s respite,\\nthen another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by\\nthe death-bed of Sir Richard. \\xa0It had not proved a happy one. \\xa0It was\\nwhispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride\\nfound among her husband’s papers several rough and incomplete drafts of\\nthe fatal letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage--and\\nSir Richard’s death, too--by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the\\nLady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the\\nfather’s death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become\\na pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his\\ndomains for bread.\\n\\nThere was a bit of Andrew’s gossip which the King listened to with a\\nlively interest--\\n\\n“There is rumour that the King is mad. \\xa0But in charity forbear to say\\n_I_ mentioned it, for ’tis death to speak of it, they say.”\\n\\nHis Majesty glared at the old man and said--\\n\\n“The King is _not_ mad, good man--and thou’lt find it to thy advantage\\nto busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this\\nseditious prattle.”\\n\\n“What doth the lad mean?” said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault\\nfrom such an unexpected quarter. \\xa0Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not\\npursue his question, but went on with his budget--\\n\\n“The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two--the 16th of\\nthe month--and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th.”\\n\\n“Methinks they must needs find him first,” muttered his Majesty; then\\nadded, confidently, “but they will look to that--and so also shall I.”\\n\\n“In the name of--”\\n\\nBut the old man got no further--a warning sign from Hendon checked his\\nremark. \\xa0He resumed the thread of his gossip--\\n\\n“Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation--and with grand hopes. \\xa0He confidently\\nlooketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord\\nProtector.”\\n\\n“What Lord Protector?” asked his Majesty.\\n\\n“His Grace the Duke of Somerset.”\\n\\n“What Duke of Somerset?”\\n\\n“Marry, there is but one--Seymour, Earl of Hertford.”\\n\\nThe King asked sharply--\\n\\n“Since when is _he_ a duke, and Lord Protector?”\\n\\n“Since the last day of January.”\\n\\n“And prithee who made him so?”\\n\\n“Himself and the Great Council--with help of the King.”\\n\\nHis Majesty started violently.  “The _King_!” he cried.  “_What_ king,\\ngood sir?”\\n\\n“What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?) \\xa0Sith we have\\nbut one, ’tis not difficult to answer--his most sacred Majesty King\\nEdward the Sixth--whom God preserve! \\xa0Yea, and a dear and gracious\\nlittle urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no--and they say he\\nmendeth daily--his praises are on all men’s lips; and all bless him,\\nlikewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in\\nEngland; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk’s\\nlife, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that\\nharry and oppress the people.”\\n\\nThis news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into\\nso deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man’s\\ngossip. He wondered if the ‘little urchin’ was the beggar-boy whom\\nhe left dressed in his own garments in the palace. \\xa0It did not seem\\npossible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would\\nbetray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be\\ndriven out, and search made for the true prince. \\xa0Could it be that the\\nCourt had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place? \\xa0No, for his\\nuncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would\\ncrush such a movement, of course. \\xa0The boy’s musings profited him\\nnothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he\\nbecame, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept. \\xa0His\\nimpatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost\\nunendurable.\\n\\nHendon’s arts all failed with the King--he could not be comforted; but a\\ncouple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their\\ngentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience.\\n\\xa0He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in\\nthe sweet and soothing influence of their presence. \\xa0He asked them why\\nthey were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled,\\nand inquired--\\n\\n“Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? \\xa0Now I grieve, for I\\nshall lose ye--they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.”\\n\\nThey did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He\\nsaid, eagerly--\\n\\n“You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me--there will be no other\\npunishment? \\xa0Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.”\\n\\nThey tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he\\npursued it--\\n\\n“Will they scourge thee? \\xa0No, no, they would not be so cruel! \\xa0Say they\\nwould not. \\xa0Come, they _will_ not, will they?”\\n\\nThe women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an\\nanswer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion--\\n\\n“Oh, thou’lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!--God will help us to\\nbear our--”\\n\\n“It is a confession!” the King broke in.  “Then they _will_ scourge\\nthee, the stony-hearted wretches! \\xa0But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot\\nbear it. \\xa0Keep up thy courage--I shall come to my own in time to save\\nthee from this bitter thing, and I will do it!”\\n\\nWhen the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.\\n\\n“They are saved!” he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, “but woe\\nis me!--for they were my comforters.”\\n\\nEach of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token\\nof remembrance. \\xa0He said he would keep these things always; and that\\nsoon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them\\nunder his protection.\\n\\nJust then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that\\nthe prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. \\xa0The King was overjoyed--it\\nwould be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air\\nonce more. \\xa0He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but\\nhis turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered\\nto follow the other prisoners with Hendon.\\n\\nThe court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky. \\xa0The\\nprisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were\\nplaced in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope\\nwas stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their\\nofficers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which\\nhad fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added\\nto the general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind\\nshivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.\\n\\nIn the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts. \\xa0A glance\\nshowed the King that these were his good friends. \\xa0He shuddered, and\\nsaid to himself, “Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. \\xa0To\\nthink that such as these should know the lash!--in England! \\xa0Ay, there’s\\nthe shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England! \\xa0They will be\\nscourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must\\nlook on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that\\nI, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect\\nthem. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a\\nday coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.\\n\\xa0For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then.”\\n\\nA great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in. \\xa0They\\nflocked around the two women, and hid them from the King’s view. A\\nclergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden.\\n\\xa0The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being\\nasked and answered, but he could not make out what was said. \\xa0Next there\\nwas a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of\\nofficials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side\\nof the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon\\nthe people.\\n\\nNow, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a\\nspectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. \\xa0Faggots had been piled\\nabout the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!\\n\\nThe women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;\\nthe yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling\\nfaggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the\\nclergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls\\ncame flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw\\nthemselves upon the women at the stake. \\xa0Instantly they were torn away\\nby the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other\\nbroke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could\\nbe stopped she had flung her arms about her mother’s neck again. \\xa0She\\nwas torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. \\xa0Two or three men\\nheld her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and\\nthrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and\\nsaying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed\\nto die with her mother. \\xa0Both the girls screamed continually, and fought\\nfor freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of\\nheart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the\\nfrantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face\\nagainst the wall, and looked no more. \\xa0He said, “That which I have seen,\\nin that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will\\nabide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the\\nnights, till I die. \\xa0Would God I had been blind!”\\n\\nHendon was watching the King. \\xa0He said to himself, with satisfaction,\\n“His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. \\xa0If he had\\nfollowed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he\\nwas King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. \\xa0Soon\\nhis delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be\\nwhole again. \\xa0God speed the day!”\\n\\nThat same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,\\nwho were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,\\nto undergo punishment for crimes committed. \\xa0The King conversed with\\nthese--he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself\\nfor the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity\\noffered--and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. \\xa0One of them was\\na poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a\\nweaver--she was to be hanged for it. \\xa0Another was a man who had been\\naccused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had\\nimagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free\\nbefore he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King’s park; this was\\nproved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows. \\xa0There was\\na tradesman’s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King;\\nthis youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its\\nowner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;\\nbut the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.\\n\\nThe King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break\\njail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne\\nand hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and\\nsave their lives.  “Poor child,” sighed Hendon, “these woeful tales\\nhave brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he\\nwould have been well in a little time.”\\n\\nAmong these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a\\ndauntless mien. \\xa0Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the\\nLord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for\\nit by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the\\nbar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to\\nimprisonment for life. \\xa0Lately he had repeated his offence; and in\\nconsequence was now under sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_,\\npay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in\\nprison for life.\\n\\n“These be honourable scars,” he said, and turned back his grey hair and\\nshowed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.\\n\\nThe King’s eye burned with passion. \\xa0He said--\\n\\n“None believe in me--neither wilt thou. \\xa0But no matter--within the\\ncompass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have\\ndishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the\\nstatute books. \\xa0The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to\\ntheir own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.” {1}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII. The sacrifice.\\n\\nMeantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and\\ninaction. \\xa0But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and\\nhe thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment\\nshould not be a part of it. \\xa0But he was mistaken about that. \\xa0He was in\\na fine fury when he found himself described as a ‘sturdy vagabond’ and\\nsentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character\\nand for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. \\xa0His pretensions as to\\nbrothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon\\nhonours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not\\neven worth examination.\\n\\nHe raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he\\nwas snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff,\\nbesides, for his irreverent conduct.\\n\\nThe King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so\\nhe was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and\\nservant. \\xa0The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for\\nbeing in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a\\nwarning, in consideration of his youth. \\xa0When the crowd at last halted,\\nhe flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting\\na place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and\\ndelay, succeeded. \\xa0There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks,\\nthe sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King\\nof England! \\xa0Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not\\nrealised the half that it meant. \\xa0His anger began to rise as the sense\\nof this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped\\nto summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air\\nand crush itself against Hendon’s cheek, and heard the crowd roar\\nits enjoyment of the episode. \\xa0He sprang across the open circle and\\nconfronted the officer in charge, crying--\\n\\n“For shame! \\xa0This is my servant--set him free! \\xa0I am the--”\\n\\n“Oh, peace!” exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, “thou’lt destroy thyself.\\nMind him not, officer, he is mad.”\\n\\n“Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I\\nhave small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that\\nI am well inclined.” \\xa0He turned to a subordinate and said, “Give the\\nlittle fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners.”\\n\\n“Half a dozen will better serve his turn,” suggested Sir Hugh, who had\\nridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings.\\n\\nThe King was seized. \\xa0He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he\\nwith the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be\\ninflicted upon his sacred person. \\xa0History was already defiled with\\nthe record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an\\nintolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful\\npage. \\xa0He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either\\ntake this punishment or beg for its remission. \\xa0Hard conditions; he\\nwould take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg.\\n\\nBut meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty.  “Let the child\\ngo,” said he; “ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he\\nis? \\xa0Let him go--I will take his lashes.”\\n\\n“Marry, a good thought--and thanks for it,” said Sir Hugh, his face\\nlighting with a sardonic satisfaction.  “Let the little beggar go, and\\ngive this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on.”\\n The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh\\nsilenced him with the potent remark, “Yes, speak up, do, and free thy\\nmind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six\\nstrokes the more.”\\n\\nHendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst\\nthe lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and\\nallowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked. “Ah, brave good\\nheart,” he said to himself, “this loyal deed shall never perish out of\\nmy memory. \\xa0I will not forget it--and neither shall _they_!” he added,\\nwith passion. \\xa0Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon’s magnanimous\\nconduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and\\nso also did his gratefulness for it. \\xa0Presently he said to himself, “Who\\nsaves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for\\nme--performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less\\nthan nothing!--when ’tis weighed against the act of him who saves his\\nprince from _shame_!”\\n\\nHendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with\\nsoldierly fortitude. \\xa0This, together with his redeeming the boy by\\ntaking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn\\nand degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings\\ndied away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows.\\n\\xa0The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once\\nmore in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour\\nwhich had prevailed there so little a while before. \\xa0The King came\\nsoftly to Hendon’s side, and whispered in his ear--\\n\\n“Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher\\nthan kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility\\nto men.” \\xa0He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon’s\\nbleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, “Edward of England\\ndubs thee Earl!”\\n\\nHendon was touched. \\xa0The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time\\nthe grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his\\ngravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward\\nmirth from showing outside. \\xa0To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory,\\nfrom the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of\\nan Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the\\ngrotesque. \\xa0He said to himself, “Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!\\n\\xa0The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a\\nspectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing! \\xa0An’ this go on, I\\nshall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and\\nmake-believe honours. \\xa0But I shall value them, all valueless as\\nthey are, for the love that doth bestow them. Better these poor mock\\ndignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right\\nspirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested\\npower.”\\n\\nThe dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away,\\nthe living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed\\ntogether again. \\xa0And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture\\na remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no\\nmatter--the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself. \\xa0A\\nlate comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who\\ndelivered a sneer at the ‘impostor,’ and was in the act of following it\\nwith a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any\\nwords, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX. To London.\\n\\nWhen Hendon’s term of service in the stocks was finished, he was\\nreleased and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His sword\\nwas restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He mounted\\nand rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet\\nrespectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when they were\\ngone.\\n\\nHendon was soon absorbed in thought. \\xa0There were questions of high\\nimport to be answered. \\xa0What should he do? \\xa0Whither should he go?\\nPowerful help must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his\\ninheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor\\nbesides. \\xa0Where could he hope to find this powerful help? \\xa0Where,\\nindeed! \\xa0It was a knotty question. By-and-by a thought occurred to him\\nwhich pointed to a possibility--the slenderest of slender possibilities,\\ncertainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that\\npromised anything at all. \\xa0He remembered what old Andrews had said about\\nthe young King’s goodness and his generous championship of the wronged\\nand unfortunate. \\xa0Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for\\njustice? \\xa0Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the\\naugust presence of a monarch? Never mind--let that matter take care of\\nitself; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should\\ncome to it. \\xa0He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and\\nexpedients: \\xa0no doubt he would be able to find a way. \\xa0Yes, he would\\nstrike for the capital. Maybe his father’s old friend Sir Humphrey\\nMarlow would help him--‘good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the\\nlate King’s kitchen, or stables, or something’--Miles could not remember\\njust what or which. \\xa0Now that he had something to turn his energies to,\\na distinctly defined object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and\\ndepression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away,\\nand he raised his head and looked about him. \\xa0He was surprised to see\\nhow far he had come; the village was away behind him. \\xa0The King was\\njogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he, too, was deep\\nin plans and thinkings. \\xa0A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon’s new-born\\ncheerfulness: \\xa0would the boy be willing to go again to a city where,\\nduring all his brief life, he had never known anything but ill-usage and\\npinching want? \\xa0But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided;\\nso Hendon reined up, and called out--\\n\\n“I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. \\xa0Thy commands, my\\nliege!”\\n\\n“To London!”\\n\\nHendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer--but astounded\\nat it too.\\n\\nThe whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it\\nended with one. \\xa0About ten o’clock on the night of the 19th of February\\nthey stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling\\njam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out\\nstrongly in the glare from manifold torches--and at that instant the\\ndecaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between\\nthem, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the\\nhurrying confusion of feet. So evanescent and unstable are men’s works\\nin this world!--the late good King is but three weeks dead and three\\ndays in his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains\\nto select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling. \\xa0A\\ncitizen stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of\\nsomebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person\\nthat came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person’s\\nfriend. \\xa0It was the right ripe time for a free fight, for the\\nfestivities of the morrow--Coronation Day--were already beginning;\\neverybody was full of strong drink and patriotism; within five minutes\\nthe free fight was occupying a good deal of ground; within ten or twelve\\nit covered an acre of so, and was become a riot. \\xa0By this time Hendon\\nand the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the\\nrush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity. \\xa0And so we leave\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX. Tom’s progress.\\n\\nWhilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly\\nfed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves\\nand murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by\\nall impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different\\nexperience.\\n\\nWhen we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side\\nfor him. \\xa0This bright side went on brightening more and more every\\nday: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and\\ndelightfulness. \\xa0He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;\\nhis embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident\\nbearing. \\xa0He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.\\n\\nHe ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence\\nwhen he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with\\nthem, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances.\\n\\xa0It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand\\nat parting.\\n\\nHe came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed\\nwith intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. \\xa0It came to be a\\nproud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession\\nof officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he\\ndoubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. \\xa0He\\nliked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the\\ndistant voices responding, “Way for the King!”\\n\\nHe even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and\\nseeming to be something more than the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece. He\\nliked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen\\nto the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who\\ncalled him brother. \\xa0O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!\\n\\nHe enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: \\xa0he found his four\\nhundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. \\xa0The\\nadulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears. \\xa0He\\nremained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all\\nthat were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: \\xa0yet\\nupon occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a\\nduke, and give him a look that would make him tremble. \\xa0Once, when his\\nroyal ‘sister,’ the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with\\nhim against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who\\nwould otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that\\ntheir august late father’s prisons had sometimes contained as high as\\nsixty thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign\\nhe had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death\\nby the executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation,\\nand commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the\\nstone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.\\n\\nDid Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince\\nwho had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to\\navenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first\\nroyal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts\\nabout the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and\\nhappy restoration to his native rights and splendours. \\xa0But as time\\nwore on, and the prince did not come, Tom’s mind became more and more\\noccupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and\\nlittle the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and\\nfinally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an\\nunwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.\\n\\nTom’s poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.\\nAt first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but\\nlater, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and\\nbetraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty\\nplace, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,\\nmade him shudder. \\xa0At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost\\nwholly. \\xa0And he was content, even glad: \\xa0for, whenever their mournful\\nand accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more\\ndespicable than the worms that crawl.\\n\\nAt midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in\\nhis rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded\\nby the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed\\nfor his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same hour, Edward,\\nthe true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with\\ntravel, and clothed in rags and shreds--his share of the results of the\\nriot--was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep\\ninterest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of\\nWestminster Abbey, busy as ants: \\xa0they were making the last preparation\\nfor the royal coronation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI. The Recognition procession.\\n\\nWhen Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a\\nthunderous murmur: \\xa0all the distances were charged with it. \\xa0It was\\nmusic to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its\\nstrength to give loyal welcome to the great day.\\n\\nPresently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful\\nfloating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the ‘recognition\\nprocession’ through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound\\nthither.\\n\\nWhen he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed\\nsuddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a\\nred tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion\\nfollowed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the\\nground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were\\nrepeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few\\nmoments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all\\nbut the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with\\nits banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak\\nprojects above a cloud-rack.\\n\\nTom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich\\ntrappings almost reached to the ground; his ‘uncle,’ the Lord Protector\\nSomerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King’s Guard\\nformed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour;\\nafter the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of\\nresplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord\\nmayor and the aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their\\ngold chains across their breasts; and after these the officers and\\nmembers of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the\\nshowy banners of the several corporations. \\xa0Also in the procession, as a\\nspecial guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable\\nArtillery Company--an organisation already three hundred years old\\nat that time, and the only military body in England possessing the\\nprivilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself\\nindependent of the commands of Parliament. \\xa0It was a brilliant\\nspectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as it\\ntook its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens. The\\nchronicler says, ‘The King, as he entered the city, was received by the\\npeople with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and all signs\\nwhich argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign; and the\\nKing, by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, and\\nmost tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself\\nno less thankful to receive the people’s goodwill than they to offer it.\\n\\xa0To all that wished him well, he gave thanks. \\xa0To such as bade “God save\\nhis Grace,” he said in return, “God save you all!” and added that “he\\nthanked them with all his heart.” Wonderfully transported were the\\npeople with the loving answers and gestures of their King.’\\n\\nIn Fenchurch Street a ‘fair child, in costly apparel,’ stood on a stage\\nto welcome his Majesty to the city. \\xa0The last verse of his greeting was\\nin these words--\\n\\n‘Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think; Welcome, again, as much\\nas tongue can tell,--Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will\\nnot shrink: God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.’\\n\\nThe people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what\\nthe child had said. \\xa0Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of\\neager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that\\nthe one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a\\nnation’s idol. \\xa0Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple\\nof his ragged Offal Court comrades--one of them the lord high admiral in\\nhis late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the\\nsame pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever. \\xa0Oh,\\nif they could only recognise him now! \\xa0What unspeakable glory it would\\nbe, if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king\\nof the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious\\ndukes and princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his\\nfeet! \\xa0But he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such\\na recognition might cost more than it would come to: \\xa0so he turned away\\nhis head, and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and\\nglad adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them\\nupon.\\n\\nEvery now and then rose the cry, “A largess! a largess!” and Tom\\nresponded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the\\nmultitude to scramble for.\\n\\nThe chronicler says, ‘At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the\\nsign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which\\nwas a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.\\nThis was an historical pageant, representing the King’s immediate\\nprogenitors. \\xa0There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense\\nwhite rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her\\nside was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the\\nsame manner: \\xa0the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the\\nwedding-ring ostentatiously displayed. \\xa0From the red and white roses\\nproceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry\\nVIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new\\nKing’s mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side. \\xa0One branch sprang\\nfrom this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of\\nEdward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant\\nwas framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.’\\n\\nThis quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people,\\nthat their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child\\nwhose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes. \\xa0But\\nTom Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him\\nthan any poetry, no matter what its quality might be. \\xa0Whithersoever Tom\\nturned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his\\neffigy’s likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new\\nwhirlwinds of applause burst forth.\\n\\nThe great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after\\nanother, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical\\ntableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or\\nmerit, of the little King’s.  ‘Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from\\nevery penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest\\ncarpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets--specimens\\nof the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this\\nthoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even\\nsurpassed.’\\n\\n“And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me--me!”\\n murmured Tom Canty.\\n\\nThe mock King’s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were\\nflashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. \\xa0At this point,\\njust as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught\\nsight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of\\nthe second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. \\xa0A\\nsickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his\\nmother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes--that old\\ninvoluntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by\\nhabit. \\xa0In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and\\npast the guards, and was at his side. \\xa0She embraced his leg, she covered\\nit with kisses, she cried, “O my child, my darling!” lifting toward him\\na face that was transfigured with joy and love. \\xa0The same instant an\\nofficer of the King’s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent\\nher reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his\\nstrong arm. \\xa0The words “I do not know you, woman!” were falling from Tom\\nCanty’s lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the\\nheart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of\\nhim, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so\\nwounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed\\nhis pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty. \\xa0His grandeurs were\\nstricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.\\n\\nThe procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting\\nsplendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty\\nthey were as if they had not been. \\xa0He neither saw nor heard. \\xa0Royalty\\nhad lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach.\\n\\xa0Remorse was eating his heart out. \\xa0He said, “Would God I were free of\\nmy captivity!”\\n\\nHe had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days\\nof his compulsory greatness.\\n\\nThe shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable\\nserpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the\\nhuzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes,\\nseeing only his mother’s face and that wounded look in it.\\n\\n“Largess, largess!” \\xa0The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.\\n\\n“Long live Edward of England!” \\xa0It seemed as if the earth shook with the\\nexplosion; but there was no response from the King. \\xa0He heard it only as\\none hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a\\ngreat distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still\\nnearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience--a voice which\\nkept repeating those shameful words, “I do not know you, woman!”\\n\\nThe words smote upon the King’s soul as the strokes of a funeral bell\\nsmite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret\\ntreacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone.\\n\\nNew glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels,\\nsprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released;\\nnew raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes: \\xa0but the\\nKing gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his\\ncomfortless breast was all the sound he heard.\\n\\nBy-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little,\\nand became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety: \\xa0an\\nabatement in the volume of the applause was observable too. \\xa0The Lord\\nProtector was quick to notice these things: \\xa0he was as quick to detect\\nthe cause. \\xa0He spurred to the King’s side, bent low in his saddle,\\nuncovered, and said--\\n\\n“My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. \\xa0The people observe thy\\ndowncast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen. \\xa0Be\\nadvised: \\xa0unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding\\nvapours, and disperse them. \\xa0Lift up thy face, and smile upon the\\npeople.”\\n\\nSo saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then\\nretired to his place. \\xa0The mock King did mechanically as he had been\\nbidden. \\xa0His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough\\nor sharp enough to detect that. \\xa0The noddings of his plumed head as he\\nsaluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess\\nwhich he delivered from his hand was royally liberal: \\xa0so the people’s\\nanxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a\\nvolume as before.\\n\\nStill once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was\\nobliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. \\xa0He whispered--\\n\\n“O dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world\\nare upon thee.” \\xa0Then he added with sharp annoyance, “Perdition catch\\nthat crazy pauper! ’twas she that hath disturbed your Highness.”\\n\\nThe gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a\\ndead voice--\\n\\n“She was my mother!”\\n\\n“My God!” groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his\\npost, “the omen was pregnant with prophecy. \\xa0He is gone mad again!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII. Coronation Day.\\n\\nLet us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster\\nAbbey, at four o’clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day.\\n\\xa0We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find\\nthe torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well\\ncontent to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall\\ncome for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their\\nlives--the coronation of a King. \\xa0Yes, London and Westminster have been\\nastir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o’clock, and already\\ncrowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying\\nto find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances\\nreserved for their sort.\\n\\nThe hours drag along tediously enough. \\xa0All stir has ceased for some\\ntime, for every gallery has long ago been packed. \\xa0We may sit, now, and\\nlook and think at our leisure. \\xa0We have glimpses, here and there\\nand yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many\\ngalleries and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other\\nportions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by\\nintervening pillars and architectural projections. \\xa0We have in view\\nthe whole of the great north transept--empty, and waiting for England’s\\nprivileged ones. \\xa0We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with\\nrich stuffs, whereon the throne stands. \\xa0The throne occupies the centre\\nof the platform, and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps.\\nWithin the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock--the stone\\nof Scone--which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned,\\nand so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for\\nEnglish monarchs. \\xa0Both the throne and its footstool are covered with\\ncloth of gold.\\n\\nStillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily.\\nBut at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are\\nextinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All\\nfeatures of the noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy,\\nfor the sun is lightly veiled with clouds.\\n\\nAt seven o’clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on\\nthe stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed\\nlike Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place\\nby an official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him\\ngathers up the lady’s long train, follows after, and, when the lady is\\nseated, arranges the train across her lap for her. \\xa0He then places her\\nfootstool according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where\\nit will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous\\ncoroneting of the nobles shall arrive.\\n\\nBy this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and\\nthe satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating\\nthem and making them comfortable. \\xa0The scene is animated enough now.\\n\\xa0There is stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere. \\xa0After a time,\\nquiet reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their\\nplaces, a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in\\nvariegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds. \\xa0There\\nare all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able\\nto go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the\\ncrowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten\\nage; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious\\nyoung matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes\\nand fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets\\nawkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to\\nthem, and their excitement will be a sore hindrance. Still, this may\\nnot happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a\\nspecial view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its\\nplace when the signal comes.\\n\\nWe have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with\\ndiamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle--but now we\\nare about to be astonished in earnest. \\xa0About nine, the clouds suddenly\\nbreak away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and\\ndrifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches\\nflames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle\\nto our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by\\nthe surprise and the beauty of the spectacle! \\xa0Presently a special envoy\\nfrom some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body\\nof foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our\\nbreath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is\\nso overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his\\nslightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.\\n\\nLet us change the tense for convenience. \\xa0The time drifted along--one\\nhour--two hours--two hours and a half; then the deep booming of\\nartillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at\\nlast; so the waiting multitude rejoiced. \\xa0All knew that a further delay\\nmust follow, for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn\\nceremony; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling\\nof the peers of the realm in their stately robes. \\xa0These were conducted\\nceremoniously to their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently\\nat hand; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with\\ninterest, for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes,\\nearls, and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred\\nyears. \\xa0When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries\\nand all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and\\nto remember.\\n\\nNow the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their\\nattendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places;\\nthese were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and\\nthese again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.\\n\\nThere was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music\\nburst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold,\\nappeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform. \\xa0The entire multitude\\nrose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued.\\n\\nThen a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and\\nthus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne.\\n\\xa0The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the\\naudience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom\\nCanty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe\\nand despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful\\nheart.\\n\\nAt last the final act was at hand. \\xa0The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted\\nup the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the\\ntrembling mock-King’s head. \\xa0In the same instant a rainbow-radiance\\nflashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every\\nindividual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised\\nit over his or her head--and paused in that attitude.\\n\\nA deep hush pervaded the Abbey. \\xa0At this impressive moment, a startling\\napparition intruded upon the scene--an apparition observed by none in\\nthe absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great\\ncentral aisle. \\xa0It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in\\ncoarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags. \\xa0He raised his hand\\nwith a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect,\\nand delivered this note of warning--\\n\\n“I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head. \\xa0I\\nam the King!”\\n\\nIn an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in\\nthe same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step\\nforward, and cried out in a ringing voice--\\n\\n“Loose him and forbear! \\xa0He _is_ the King!”\\n\\nA sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly\\nrose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and\\nat the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether\\nthey were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming. \\xa0The Lord\\nProtector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and\\nexclaimed in a voice of authority--\\n\\n“Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again--seize the\\nvagabond!”\\n\\nHe would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried\\nout--\\n\\n“On your peril! \\xa0Touch him not, he is the King!”\\n\\nThe hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved,\\nno one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so\\nstrange and surprising an emergency. \\xa0While all minds were struggling to\\nright themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port\\nand confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while\\nthe tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the\\nplatform, and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell\\non his knees before him and said--\\n\\n“Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to\\nthee, and say, ‘Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!’”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector’s eye fell sternly upon the new-comer’s face; but\\nstraightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression\\nof wondering surprise. \\xa0This thing happened also to the other great\\nofficers. \\xa0They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common\\nand unconscious impulse. \\xa0The thought in each mind was the same:  “What\\na strange resemblance!”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he\\nsaid, with grave respectfulness--\\n\\n“By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which--”\\n\\n“I will answer them, my lord.”\\n\\nThe Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the\\nprince, the princesses--the boy answered them correctly and without\\nhesitating. \\xa0He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late\\nKing’s apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales.\\n\\nIt was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable--so all said\\nthat heard it. \\xa0The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty’s hopes to\\nrun high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said--\\n\\n“It is true it is most wonderful--but it is no more than our lord the\\nKing likewise can do.” \\xa0This remark, and this reference to himself as\\nstill the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from\\nunder him.  “These are not _proofs_,” added the Protector.\\n\\nThe tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed--but in the wrong\\ndirection; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne,\\nand sweeping the other out to sea. \\xa0The Lord Protector communed with\\nhimself--shook his head--the thought forced itself upon him, “It is\\nperilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as\\nthis; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.” \\xa0He turned\\nand said--\\n\\n“Sir Thomas, arrest this--No, hold!” \\xa0His face lighted, and he\\nconfronted the ragged candidate with this question--\\n\\n“Where lieth the Great Seal? \\xa0Answer me this truly, and the riddle is\\nunriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales _can_ so answer! On so\\ntrivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!”\\n\\nIt was a lucky thought, a happy thought. \\xa0That it was so considered by\\nthe great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from\\neye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.\\nYes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the\\nvanished Great Seal--this forlorn little impostor had been taught his\\nlesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself\\ncould not answer _that_ question--ah, very good, very good indeed;\\nnow we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in\\nshort order! And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with\\nsatisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy\\nof guilty confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of\\nthe sort happen--how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a\\nconfident and untroubled voice, and say--\\n\\n“There is nought in this riddle that is difficult.” \\xa0Then, without so\\nmuch as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command,\\nwith the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: “My Lord\\nSt. John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace--for none knoweth\\nthe place better than you--and, close down to the floor, in the left\\ncorner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you\\nshall find in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little\\njewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of--no, nor\\nany soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did\\ncontrive it for me. The first thing that falleth under your eye will be\\nthe Great Seal--fetch it hither.”\\n\\nAll the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see\\nthe little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent\\nfear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing\\nair of having known him all his life. \\xa0The peer was almost surprised\\ninto obeying. \\xa0He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly\\nrecovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush.\\n\\xa0Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply--\\n\\n“Why dost thou hesitate? \\xa0Hast not heard the King’s command? \\xa0Go!”\\n\\nThe Lord St. John made a deep obeisance--and it was observed that it was\\na significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered\\nat either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between\\nthe two--and took his leave.\\n\\nNow began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group\\nwhich was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent--a\\nmovement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly,\\nwhereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join\\nthemselves to another--a movement which, little by little, in the\\npresent case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty\\nand clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer.\\n\\xa0Tom Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep\\nsuspense and waiting--during which even the few faint hearts still\\nremaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to\\nglide, one by one, over to the majority. \\xa0So at last Tom Canty, in his\\nroyal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world,\\na conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.\\n\\nNow the Lord St. John was seen returning. \\xa0As he advanced up\\nthe mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of\\nconversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by\\na profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his footfalls\\npulsed with a dull and distant sound. \\xa0Every eye was fastened upon him\\nas he moved along. \\xa0He reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved\\ntoward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance, and said--\\n\\n“Sire, the Seal is not there!”\\n\\nA mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more\\nhaste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from\\nthe presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown. \\xa0In a moment\\nhe stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which\\nwas concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks. \\xa0The Lord\\nProtector called out fiercely--\\n\\n“Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town--the\\npaltry knave is worth no more consideration!”\\n\\nOfficers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them\\noff and said--\\n\\n“Back! \\xa0Whoso touches him perils his life!”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. \\xa0He said to the\\nLord St. John--\\n\\n“Searched you well?--but it boots not to ask that. \\xa0It doth seem passing\\nstrange. \\xa0Little things, trifles, slip out of one’s ken, and one does\\nnot think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the\\nSeal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it\\nagain--a massy golden disk--”\\n\\nTom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted--\\n\\n“Hold, that is enough! \\xa0Was it round?--and thick?--and had it letters\\nand devices graved upon it?--yes? \\xa0Oh, _now_ I know what this Great Seal\\nis that there’s been such worry and pother about. An’ ye had described\\nit to me, ye could have had it three weeks ago. \\xa0Right well I know where\\nit lies; but it was not I that put it there--first.”\\n\\n“Who, then, my liege?” asked the Lord Protector.\\n\\n“He that stands there--the rightful King of England. \\xa0And he shall tell\\nyou himself where it lies--then you will believe he knew it of his own\\nknowledge. \\xa0Bethink thee, my King--spur thy memory--it was the last, the\\nvery _last_ thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from\\nthe palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me.”\\n\\nA silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes\\nwere fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated\\nbrow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless\\nrecollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would\\nseat him upon a throne--unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and\\nall--a pauper and an outcast. \\xa0Moment after moment passed--the moments\\nbuilt themselves into minutes--still the boy struggled silently on, and\\ngave no sign. \\xa0But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and\\nsaid, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice--\\n\\n“I call the scene back--all of it--but the Seal hath no place in it.”\\n \\xa0He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, “My lords and\\ngentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of\\nthis evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being\\npowerless. \\xa0But--”\\n\\n“Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!” cried Tom Canty, in a panic,\\n“wait!--think! \\xa0Do not give up!--the cause is not lost! \\xa0Nor _shall_ be,\\nneither! List to what I say--follow every word--I am going to bring that\\nmorning back again, every hap just as it happened. \\xa0We talked--I told\\nyou of my sisters, Nan and Bet--ah, yes, you remember that; and about\\nmine old grandam--and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court--yes,\\nyou remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall\\nrecall everything. \\xa0You gave me food and drink, and did with princely\\ncourtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame\\nme before them--ah, yes, this also you remember.”\\n\\nAs Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in\\nrecognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in\\npuzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could\\nthis impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come\\nabout? \\xa0Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and\\nso stupefied, before.\\n\\n“For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. \\xa0Then we stood before\\na mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had\\nbeen no change made--yes, you remember that. \\xa0Then you noticed that the\\nsoldier had hurt my hand--look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with\\nit, the fingers are so stiff. \\xa0At this your Highness sprang up, vowing\\nvengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door--you passed a\\ntable--that thing you call the Seal lay on that table--you snatched\\nit up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it--your eye\\ncaught sight of--”\\n\\n“There, ’tis sufficient!--and the good God be thanked!” exclaimed the\\nragged claimant, in a mighty excitement.  “Go, my good St. John--in an\\narm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou’lt find\\nthe Seal!”\\n\\n“Right, my King! right!” cried Tom Canty; “_Now_ the sceptre of England\\nis thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he\\nhad been born dumb! \\xa0Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!”\\n\\nThe whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind\\nwith uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement. \\xa0On the floor\\nand on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst\\nforth, and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was\\ninterested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear,\\nor he was shouting into his neighbour’s ear. \\xa0Time--nobody knew how much\\nof it--swept by unheeded and unnoted. \\xa0At last a sudden hush fell upon\\nthe house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform,\\nand held the Great Seal aloft in his hand. \\xa0Then such a shout went up--\\n\\n“Long live the true King!”\\n\\nFor five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical\\ninstruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and\\nthrough it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England,\\nstood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious\\nplatform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him.\\n\\nThen all rose, and Tom Canty cried out--\\n\\n“Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy\\nservant, his shreds and remnants again.”\\n\\nThe Lord Protector spoke up--\\n\\n“Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower.”\\n\\nBut the new King, the true King, said--\\n\\n“I will not have it so. \\xa0But for him I had not got my crown again--none\\nshall lay a hand upon him to harm him. \\xa0And as for thee, my good uncle,\\nmy Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward\\nthis poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke”--the Protector\\nblushed--“yet he was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title\\nworth now? \\xa0To-morrow you shall sue to me, _through him_, for its\\nconfirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain.”\\n\\nUnder this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from\\nthe front for the moment. \\xa0The King turned to Tom, and said kindly--“My\\npoor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I\\ncould not remember it myself?”\\n\\n“Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days.”\\n\\n“Used it--yet could not explain where it was?”\\n\\n“I did not know it was _that_ they wanted. \\xa0They did not describe it,\\nyour Majesty.”\\n\\n“Then how used you it?”\\n\\nThe red blood began to steal up into Tom’s cheeks, and he dropped his\\neyes and was silent.\\n\\n“Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing,” said the King.  “How used you\\nthe Great Seal of England?”\\n\\nTom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out--\\n\\n“To crack nuts with!”\\n\\nPoor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him\\noff his feet. \\xa0But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was\\nnot the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of\\nroyalty, this reply disposed of it utterly.\\n\\nMeantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom’s\\nshoulders to the King’s, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight\\nunder it. \\xa0Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King\\nwas anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered\\nthe news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII. Edward as King.\\n\\nMiles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on\\nLondon Bridge--he was more so when he got out of it. \\xa0He had but little\\nmoney when he got in, none at all when he got out. \\xa0The pickpockets had\\nstripped him of his last farthing.\\n\\nBut no matter, so he found his boy. \\xa0Being a soldier, he did not go at\\nhis task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his\\ncampaign.\\n\\nWhat would the boy naturally do? \\xa0Where would he naturally go?\\nWell--argued Miles--he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that\\nis the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well\\nas of sound ones. \\xa0Whereabouts were his former haunts? \\xa0His rags,\\ntaken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even\\nclaimed to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another\\nof the poorest and meanest districts of London. \\xa0Would the search for\\nhim be difficult, or long? \\xa0No, it was likely to be easy and brief. \\xa0He\\nwould not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of\\na big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor\\nlittle friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself\\nwith pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself\\nKing, as usual. \\xa0Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people,\\nand carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving\\nwords, and the two would never be separated any more.\\n\\nSo Miles started on his quest. \\xa0Hour after hour he tramped through back\\nalleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no\\nend of them, but never any sign of the boy. \\xa0This greatly surprised him,\\nbut did not discourage him. \\xa0To his notion, there was nothing the matter\\nwith his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the\\ncampaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be\\nshort.\\n\\nWhen daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed\\nmany a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired,\\nrather hungry and very sleepy. \\xa0He wanted some breakfast, but there was\\nno way to get it. \\xa0To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning\\nhis sword, he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour;\\nhe could spare some of his clothes--yes, but one could as easily find a\\ncustomer for a disease as for such clothes.\\n\\nAt noon he was still tramping--among the rabble which followed after\\nthe royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would\\nattract his little lunatic powerfully. \\xa0He followed the pageant through\\nall its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster\\nand the Abbey. \\xa0He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes\\nthat were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and\\nperplexed, and finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive\\nsome way to better his plan of campaign. \\xa0By-and-by, when he came to\\nhimself out of his musings, he discovered that the town was far behind\\nhim and that the day was growing old. \\xa0He was near the river, and in the\\ncountry; it was a region of fine rural seats--not the sort of district\\nto welcome clothes like his.\\n\\nIt was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee\\nof a hedge to rest and think. \\xa0Drowsiness presently began to settle upon\\nhis senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear,\\nand he said to himself, “The new King is crowned,” and straightway fell\\nasleep. \\xa0He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.\\nHe did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning.\\n\\nHe got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river,\\nstayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward\\nWestminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time.\\n\\xa0Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with\\nold Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and--but that was enough\\nof a plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when\\nthis first stage should be accomplished.\\n\\nToward eleven o’clock he approached the palace; and although a host of\\nshowy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not\\ninconspicuous--his costume took care of that. \\xa0He watched these people’s\\nfaces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might\\nbe willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant--as to trying to get\\ninto the palace himself, that was simply out of the question.\\n\\nPresently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned\\nhis figure well, saying to himself, “An’ that is not the very vagabond\\nhis Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass--though belike I\\nwas that before. \\xa0He answereth the description to a rag--that God should\\nmake two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. \\xa0I\\nwould I could contrive an excuse to speak with him.”\\n\\nMiles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man\\ngenerally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from\\nbehind; and observing a strong interest in the boy’s eyes, he stepped\\ntoward him and said--\\n\\n“You have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?”\\n\\n“Yes, your worship.”\\n\\n“Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?”\\n\\nThe boy started, and said to himself, “Lord! mine old departed father!”\\n Then he answered aloud, “Right well, your worship.”\\n\\n“Good--is he within?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said the boy; and added, to himself, “within his grave.”\\n\\n“Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say\\na word in his ear?”\\n\\n“I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir.”\\n\\n“Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without--I shall be\\ngreatly bounden to you, my good lad.”\\n\\nThe boy looked disappointed.  “The King did not name him so,” he said to\\nhimself; “but it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give\\nhis Majesty news of t’other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant.” \\xa0So he said\\nto Miles, “Step in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you\\nword.”\\n\\nHendon retired to the place indicated--it was a recess sunk in the\\npalace wall, with a stone bench in it--a shelter for sentinels in bad\\nweather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge\\nof an officer, passed by. \\xa0The officer saw him, halted his men, and\\ncommanded Hendon to come forth. \\xa0He obeyed, and was promptly arrested\\nas a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace.\\n\\xa0Things began to look ugly. \\xa0Poor Miles was going to explain, but the\\nofficer roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and\\nsearch him.\\n\\n“God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat,” said poor Miles; “I\\nhave searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs.”\\n\\nNothing was found but a document. \\xa0The officer tore it open, and Hendon\\nsmiled when he recognised the ‘pot-hooks’ made by his lost little friend\\nthat black day at Hendon Hall. \\xa0The officer’s face grew dark as he read\\nthe English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he\\nlistened.\\n\\n“Another new claimant of the Crown!” cried the officer.  “Verily they\\nbreed like rabbits, to-day. \\xa0Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep\\nhim fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the\\nKing.”\\n\\nHe hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers.\\n\\n“Now is my evil luck ended at last,” muttered Hendon, “for I shall\\ndangle at a rope’s end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of\\nwriting. \\xa0And what will become of my poor lad!--ah, only the good God\\nknoweth.”\\n\\nBy-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he\\nplucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a\\nman. \\xa0The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his\\nsword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said--\\n\\n“Please you, sir, to follow me.”\\n\\nHendon followed, saying to himself, “An’ I were not travelling to death\\nand judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this\\nknave for his mock courtesy.”\\n\\nThe two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of\\nthe palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into\\nthe hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect\\nand led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows\\nof splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed\\nalong, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately\\nscarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase,\\namong flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room,\\nclove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then\\nmade a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in\\nthe middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant\\nfrowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles.\\n\\nMiles Hendon was entirely bewildered. \\xa0There sat the young King, under\\na canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside,\\nspeaking with a sort of human bird of paradise--a duke, maybe. \\xa0Hendon\\nobserved to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death\\nin the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public\\nhumiliation added. \\xa0He wished the King would hurry about it--some of the\\ngaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive. \\xa0At this moment\\nthe King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his\\nface. The sight nearly took his breath away!--He stood gazing at the\\nfair young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated--\\n\\n“Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!”\\n\\nHe muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then\\nturned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the\\nsplendid saloon, murmuring, “But these are _real_--verily these are\\n_real_--surely it is not a dream.”\\n\\nHe stared at the King again--and thought, “_Is_ it a dream . . . or _is_\\nhe the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom\\no’ Bedlam I took him for--who shall solve me this riddle?”\\n\\nA sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up\\na chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!\\n\\nA buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a\\nvoice exclaimed--\\n\\n“Up, thou mannerless clown! would’st sit in the presence of the King?”\\n\\nThe disturbance attracted his Majesty’s attention, who stretched forth\\nhis hand and cried out--\\n\\n“Touch him not, it is his right!”\\n\\nThe throng fell back, stupefied. \\xa0The King went on--\\n\\n“Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and\\nwell-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and\\nsaved his prince from bodily harm and possible death--and for this he is\\na knight, by the King’s voice. \\xa0Also learn, that for a higher service,\\nin that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon\\nhimself, he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold\\nand lands meet for the dignity. \\xa0More--the privilege which he hath just\\nexercised is his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs\\nof his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the\\nMajesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall\\nendure. \\xa0Molest him not.”\\n\\nTwo persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country\\nduring this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes,\\nstood listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the\\nscarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment.\\n\\xa0These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith. \\xa0But the new Earl did not\\nsee them. \\xa0He was still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and\\nmuttering--\\n\\n“Oh, body o’ me! \\xa0_this_ my pauper! \\xa0This my lunatic! \\xa0This is he whom\\n_I_ would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and\\nseven-and-twenty servants! \\xa0This is he who had never known aught but\\nrags for raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet! \\xa0This is he\\nwhom _I_ adopted and would make respectable! Would God I had a bag to\\nhide my head in!”\\n\\nThen his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his\\nknees, with his hands between the King’s, and swore allegiance and did\\nhomage for his lands and titles. \\xa0Then he rose and stood respectfully\\naside, a mark still for all eyes--and much envy, too.\\n\\nNow the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and\\nkindling eye--\\n\\n“Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him\\nunder lock and key till I have need of him.”\\n\\nThe late Sir Hugh was led away.\\n\\nThere was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell\\napart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between\\nthese living walls, preceded by an usher. \\xa0He knelt before the King, who\\nsaid--\\n\\n“I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased\\nwith thee. \\xa0Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and\\nmercy. \\xa0Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again? \\xa0Good; they\\nshall be cared for--and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the\\nlaw consent. \\xa0Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they\\nthat abide in the shelter of Christ’s Hospital and share the King’s\\nbounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser\\nparts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its\\nhonourable body of governors, during life. \\xa0And for that he hath been\\na king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due;\\nwherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and\\nnone shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the\\npeople that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his\\ndue of reverence or fail to give him salutation. \\xa0He hath the throne’s\\nprotection, he hath the crown’s support, he shall be known and called by\\nthe honourable title of the King’s Ward.”\\n\\nThe proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King’s hand, and was\\nconducted from the presence. \\xa0He did not waste any time, but flew to his\\nmother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help\\nhim enjoy the great news. {1}\\n\\nConclusion. Justice and retribution.\\n\\nWhen the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by confession of\\nHugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command, that\\nday at Hendon Hall--a command assisted and supported by the perfectly\\ntrustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon,\\nand stand firmly to it, he would have her life; whereupon she said,\\n“Take it!”--she did not value it--and she would not repudiate\\nMiles; then the husband said he would spare her life but have Miles\\nassassinated! \\xa0This was a different matter; so she gave her word and\\nkept it.\\n\\nHugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother’s\\nestates and title, because the wife and brother would not testify\\nagainst him--and the former would not have been allowed to do it, even\\nif she had wanted to. \\xa0Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the\\ncontinent, where he presently died; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent\\nmarried his relict. There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon\\nvillage when the couple paid their first visit to the Hall.\\n\\nTom Canty’s father was never heard of again.\\n\\nThe King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave,\\nand reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler’s gang, and put\\nhim in the way of a comfortable livelihood.\\n\\nHe also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine. He\\nprovided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he\\nsaw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the official who laid the\\nundeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon’s back.\\n\\nHe saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon, and\\nalso the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver; but he\\nwas too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in\\nthe royal forest.\\n\\nHe showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed\\nto have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in\\nthe public esteem and become a great and honoured man.\\n\\nAs long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his\\nadventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him\\naway from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed\\nhimself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey\\nand climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor’s tomb, and then slept\\nso long, next day, that he came within one of missing the Coronation\\naltogether. \\xa0He said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson\\nkept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to\\nhis people; and so, whilst his life was spared he should continue to\\ntell the story, and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his\\nmemory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart.\\n\\nMiles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all through his\\nbrief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The good Earl\\nof Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege; but he\\nexercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was\\ncalled from this world--once at the accession of Queen Mary, and once at\\nthe accession of Queen Elizabeth. \\xa0A descendant of his exercised it\\nat the accession of James I. \\xa0Before this one’s son chose to use the\\nprivilege, near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the ‘privilege\\nof the Kents’ had faded out of most people’s memories; so, when the Kent\\nof that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the\\nsovereign’s presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house,\\nthere was a fine stir indeed! \\xa0But the matter was soon explained, and\\nthe right confirmed. \\xa0The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the\\nCommonwealth fighting for the King, and the odd privilege ended with\\nhim.\\n\\nTom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired old\\nfellow, of grave and benignant aspect. \\xa0As long as he lasted he was\\nhonoured; and he was also reverenced, for his striking and peculiar\\ncostume kept the people reminded that ‘in his time he had been royal;’\\nso, wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart, making way for him, and\\nwhispering, one to another, “Doff thy hat, it is the King’s Ward!”--and\\nso they saluted, and got his kindly smile in return--and they valued it,\\ntoo, for his was an honourable history.\\n\\nYes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived them\\nworthily. \\xa0More than once, when some great dignitary, some gilded vassal\\nof the crown, made argument against his leniency, and urged that some\\nlaw which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose,\\nand wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind,\\nthe young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate\\neyes upon him and answered--\\n\\n“What dost _thou_ know of suffering and oppression? \\xa0I and my people\\nknow, but not thou.”\\n\\nThe reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those harsh\\ntimes. \\xa0Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try to keep this in\\nour minds, to his credit.\\n\\nFOOTNOTES AND TWAIN’S NOTES\\n\\n{1} \\xa0For Mark Twain’s note see below under the relevant chapter heading.\\n\\n{2} \\xa0He refers to the order of baronets, or baronettes; the barones\\nminores, as distinct from the parliamentary barons--not, it need hardly\\nbe said, to the baronets of later creation.\\n\\n{3} \\xa0The lords of Kingsale, descendants of De Courcy, still enjoy this\\ncurious privilege.\\n\\n{4} \\xa0Hume.\\n\\n{5} \\xa0Ib.\\n\\n{6} \\xa0Leigh Hunt’s ‘The Town,’ p.408, quotation from an early tourist.\\n\\n{7} \\xa0Canting terms for various kinds of thieves, beggars and vagabonds,\\nand their female companions.\\n\\n{8} \\xa0From ‘The English Rogue.’ \\xa0London, 1665.\\n\\n{9} \\xa0Hume’s England.\\n\\n{10} \\xa0See Dr. J.

Christ’s Hospital Costume.\\n\\nIt is most reasonable to regard the dress as copied from the costume\\nof the citizens of London of that period, when long blue coats were the\\ncommon habit of apprentices and serving-men, and yellow stockings\\nwere generally worn; the coat fits closely to the body, but has loose\\nsleeves, and beneath is worn a sleeveless yellow under-coat; around the\\nwaist is a red leathern girdle; a clerical band around the neck, and\\na small flat black cap, about the size of a saucer, completes the\\ncostume.--Timbs’ Curiosities of London.\\n\\nNOTE 2, Chapter IV.\\n\\nIt appears that Christ’s Hospital was not originally founded as a\\n_school_; its object was to rescue children from the streets, to\\nshelter, feed, clothe them.--Timbs’ Curiosities of London.\\n\\nNOTE 3, Chapter V. The Duke of Norfolk’s Condemnation commanded.\\n\\nThe King was now approaching fast towards his end; and fearing lest\\nNorfolk should escape him, he sent a message to the Commons, by which\\nhe desired them to hasten the Bill, on pretence that Norfolk enjoyed the\\ndignity of Earl Marshal, and it was necessary to appoint another, who\\nmight officiate at the ensuing ceremony of installing his son Prince of\\nWales.--Hume’s History of England, vol. iii. p. 307.\\n\\nNOTE 4, Chapter VII.\\n\\nIt was not till the end of this reign (Henry VIII.) that any salads,\\ncarrots, turnips, or other edible roots were produced in England. \\xa0The\\nlittle of these vegetables that was used was formerly imported from\\nHolland and Flanders. \\xa0Queen Catherine, when she wanted a salad, was\\nobliged to despatch a messenger thither on purpose.--Hume’s History of\\nEngland, vol. iii. p. 314.\\n\\nNOTE 5, Chapter VIII. Attainder of Norfolk.\\n\\nThe House of Peers, without examining the prisoner, without trial or\\nevidence, passed a Bill of Attainder against him and sent it down to the\\nCommons . . . The obsequious Commons obeyed his (the King’s)\\ndirections; and the King, having affixed the Royal assent to the Bill by\\ncommissioners, issued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning\\nof January 29 (the next day).--Hume’s History of England, vol iii. p\\n306.\\n\\nNOTE 6, Chapter X. The Loving-cup.\\n\\nThe loving-cup, and the peculiar ceremonies observed in drinking from\\nit, are older than English history. \\xa0It is thought that both are Danish\\nimportations. \\xa0As far back as knowledge goes, the loving-cup has always\\nbeen drunk at English banquets. \\xa0Tradition explains the ceremonies in\\nthis way. \\xa0In the rude ancient times it was deemed a wise precaution\\nto have both hands of both drinkers employed, lest while the pledger\\npledged his love and fidelity to the pledgee, the pledgee take that\\nopportunity to slip a dirk into him!\\n\\nNOTE 7, Chapter XI. The Duke of Norfolk’s narrow Escape.\\n\\nHad Henry VIII. survived a few hours longer, his order for the duke’s\\nexecution would have been carried into effect. ‘But news being\\ncarried to the Tower that the King himself had expired that night,\\nthe lieutenant deferred obeying the warrant; and it was not thought\\nadvisable by the Council to begin a new reign by the death of the\\ngreatest nobleman in the kingdom, who had been condemned by a sentence\\nso unjust and tyrannical.’--Hume’s History of England, vol. iii, p. 307.\\n\\nNOTE 8, Chapter XIV. The Whipping-boy.\\n\\nJames I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little\\nfellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their\\nlessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my\\nown purposes.\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XV.\\n\\nCharacter of Hertford.\\n\\nThe young King discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who\\nwas, in the main, a man of moderation and probity.--Hume’s History of\\nEngland, vol. iii, p324.\\n\\nBut if he (the Protector) gave offence by assuming too much state, he\\ndeserves great praise on account of the laws passed this session,\\nby which the rigour of former statutes was much mitigated, and some\\nsecurity given to the freedom of the constitution. \\xa0All laws were\\nrepealed which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the\\ntwenty-fifth of Edward III.; all laws enacted during the late reign\\nextending the crime of felony; all the former laws against Lollardy or\\nheresy, together with the statute of the Six Articles. \\xa0None were to be\\naccused for words, but within a month after they were spoken. \\xa0By\\nthese repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever had passed\\nin England were annulled; and some dawn, both of civil and religious\\nliberty, began to appear to the people. \\xa0A repeal also passed of that\\nlaw, the destruction of all laws, by which the King’s proclamation was\\nmade of equal force with a statute.--Ibid. vol. iii. p. 339.\\n\\nBoiling to Death.\\n\\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. poisoners were, by Act of Parliament,\\ncondemned to be _boiled to death_. \\xa0This Act was repealed in the\\nfollowing reign.\\n\\nIn Germany, even in the seventeenth century, this horrible punishment\\nwas inflicted on coiners and counterfeiters. \\xa0Taylor, the Water Poet,\\ndescribes an execution he witnessed in Hamburg in 1616. \\xa0The judgment\\npronounced against a coiner of false money was that he should ‘_be\\nboiled to death in oil_; not thrown into the vessel at once, but with\\na pulley or rope to be hanged under the armpits, and then let down into\\nthe oil _by degrees_; first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil\\nhis flesh from his bones alive.’--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws,\\nTrue and False, p. 13.\\n\\nThe Famous Stocking Case.\\n\\nA woman and her daughter, _nine years old_, were hanged in Huntingdon\\nfor selling their souls to the devil, and raising a storm by pulling off\\ntheir stockings!--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False,\\np. 20.\\n\\nNOTE 10, Chapter XVII. Enslaving.\\n\\nSo young a King and so ignorant a peasant were likely to make mistakes;\\nand this is an instance in point. \\xa0This peasant was suffering from this\\nlaw _by anticipation_; the King was venting his indignation against a\\nlaw which was not yet in existence; for this hideous statute was to\\nhave birth in this little King’s _own reign_. However, we know, from the\\nhumanity of his character, that it could never have been suggested by\\nhim.\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XXIII. Death for Trifling Larcenies.\\n\\nWhen Connecticut and New Haven were framing their first codes, larceny\\nabove the value of twelve pence was a capital crime in England--as it\\nhad been since the time of Henry I.--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue\\nLaws, True and False, p. 17.\\n\\nThe curious old book called The English Rogue makes the limit thirteen\\npence ha’penny: \\xa0death being the portion of any who steal a thing ‘above\\nthe value of thirteen pence ha’penny.’\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XXVII.\\n\\nFrom many descriptions of larceny the law expressly took away the\\nbenefit of clergy: \\xa0to steal a horse, or a _hawk_, or woollen cloth from\\nthe weaver, was a hanging matter. \\xa0So it was to kill a deer from the\\nKing’s forest, or to export sheep from the kingdom.--Dr. J. Hammond\\nTrumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p.13.\\n\\nWilliam Prynne, a learned barrister, was sentenced (long after Edward\\nVI.’s time) to lose both his ears in the pillory, to degradation from\\nthe bar, a fine of 3,000 pounds, and imprisonment for life. \\xa0Three years\\nafterwards he gave new offence to Laud by publishing a pamphlet against\\nthe hierarchy. \\xa0He was again prosecuted, and was sentenced to lose _what\\nremained of his ears_, to pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, to be _branded on\\nboth his cheeks_ with the letters S. L. (for Seditious Libeller), and to\\nremain in prison for life. \\xa0The severity of this sentence was equalled\\nby the savage rigour of its execution.--Ibid. p. 12.\\n\\nNOTES to Chapter XXXIII.\\n\\nChrist’s Hospital, or Bluecoat School, ’the noblest institution in the\\nworld.’\\n\\nThe ground on which the Priory of the Grey Friars stood was conferred\\nby Henry VIII. on the Corporation of London (who caused the institution\\nthere of a home for poor boys and girls). Subsequently, Edward VI.\\ncaused the old Priory to be properly repaired, and founded within\\nit that noble establishment called the Bluecoat School, or Christ’s\\nHospital, for the _education_ and maintenance of orphans and the\\nchildren of indigent persons . . . Edward would not let him (Bishop\\nRidley) depart till the letter was written (to the Lord Mayor), and then\\ncharged him to deliver it himself, and signify his special request and\\ncommandment that no time might be lost in proposing what was convenient,\\nand apprising him of the proceedings. \\xa0The work was zealously\\nundertaken, Ridley himself engaging in it; and the result was the\\nfounding of Christ’s Hospital for the education of poor children. (The\\nKing endowed several other charities at the same time.) “Lord God,” said\\nhe, “I yield Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast given me life thus\\nlong to finish this work to the glory of Thy name!” \\xa0That innocent and\\nmost exemplary life was drawing rapidly to its close, and in a few days\\nhe rendered up his spirit to his Creator, praying God to defend the\\nrealm from Papistry.--J. Heneage Jesse’s London: \\xa0its Celebrated\\nCharacters and Places.\\n\\nIn the Great Hall hangs a large picture of King Edward VI. seated on his\\nthrone, in a scarlet and ermined robe, holding the sceptre in his left\\nhand, and presenting with the other the Charter to the kneeling Lord\\nMayor. \\xa0By his side stands the Chancellor, holding the seals, and next\\nto him are other officers of state. \\xa0Bishop Ridley kneels before him\\nwith uplifted hands, as if supplicating a blessing on the event; whilst\\nthe Aldermen, etc., with the Lord Mayor, kneel on both sides, occupying\\nthe middle ground of the picture; and lastly, in front, are a double row\\nof boys on one side and girls on the other, from the master and matron\\ndown to the boy and girl who have stepped forward from their respective\\nrows, and kneel with raised hands before the King.--Timbs’ Curiosities\\nof London, p. 98.\\n\\nChrist’s Hospital, by ancient custom, possesses the privilege of\\naddressing the Sovereign on the occasion of his or her coming into the\\nCity to partake of the hospitality of the Corporation of London.--Ibid.\\n\\nThe Dining Hall, with its lobby and organ-gallery, occupies the entire\\nstorey, which is 187 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 47 feet high; it is\\nlit by nine large windows, filled with stained glass on the south side;\\nand is, next to Westminster Hall, the noblest room in the metropolis.\\n\\xa0Here the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the\\n‘Suppings in Public,’ to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued\\nby the Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ’s Hospital. \\xa0The tables\\nare laid with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured\\nfrom leathern jacks, and bread brought in large baskets. \\xa0The official\\ncompany enter; the Lord Mayor, or President, takes his seat in a state\\nchair made of oak from St. Catherine’s Church, by the Tower; a hymn\\nis sung, accompanied by the organ; a ‘Grecian,’ or head boy, reads the\\nprayers from the pulpit, silence being enforced by three drops of a\\nwooden hammer. \\xa0After prayer the supper commences, and the visitors walk\\nbetween the tables. \\xa0At its close the ’trade-boys’ take up the baskets,\\nbowls, jacks, piggins, and candlesticks, and pass in procession, the\\nbowing to the Governors being curiously formal. \\xa0This spectacle was\\nwitnessed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1845.\\n\\nAmong the more eminent Bluecoat boys are Joshua Barnes, editor\\nof Anacreon and Euripides; Jeremiah Markland, the eminent critic,\\nparticularly in Greek Literature; Camden, the antiquary; Bishop\\nStillingfleet; Samuel Richardson, the novelist; Thomas Mitchell, the\\ntranslator of Aristophanes; Thomas Barnes, many years editor of the\\nLondon Times; Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.\\n\\nNo boy is admitted before he is seven years old, or after he is nine;\\nand no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King’s boys and\\n‘Grecians’ alone excepted. \\xa0There are about 500 Governors, at the head\\nof whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales. \\xa0The qualification\\nfor a Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.\\n\\nGENERAL NOTE.\\n\\nOne hears much about the ‘hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,’ and is\\naccustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned. \\xa0There are people\\nin America--and even in England!--who imagine that they were a very\\nmonument of malignity, pitilessness, and inhumanity; whereas in reality\\nthey were about the first _sweeping departure from judicial atrocity_\\nwhich the ‘civilised’ world had seen. \\xa0This humane and kindly Blue Law\\nCode, of two hundred and forty years ago, stands all by itself,\\nwith ages of bloody law on the further side of it, and a century and\\nthree-quarters of bloody English law on _this_ side of it.\\n\\nThere has never been a time--under the Blue Laws or any other--when\\nabove _fourteen_ crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut. \\xa0But in\\nEngland, within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind,\\n_two hundred and twenty-three_ crimes were punishable by death! {10}\\n\\xa0These facts are worth knowing--and worth thinking about, too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince and The Pauper,\\nComplete by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRINCE AND THE PAUPER ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 1837-0.txt or 1837-0.zip ***** This and\\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/3/1837/\\n\\nProduced by David Widger.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.

All the\\nother parts are but members, important in themselves, yet more important\\nin their relations to this. Exclusive of the Lake basin and of 300,000\\nsquare miles in Texas and New Mexico, which in many aspects form a part\\nof it, this basin contains about 1,250,000 square miles. In extent it is\\nthe second great valley of the world, being exceeded only by that of the\\nAmazon. The valley of the frozen Obi approaches it in extent; that of\\nLa Plata comes next in space, and probably in habitable capacity, having\\nabout eight-ninths of its area; then comes that of the Yenisei, with\\nabout seven-ninths; the Lena, Amoor, Hoang-ho, Yang-tse-kiang, and\\nNile, five-ninths; the Ganges, less than one-half; the Indus, less\\nthan one-third; the Euphrates, one-fifth; the Rhine, one-fifteenth. It\\nexceeds in extent the whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia, Norway,\\nand Sweden. _It would contain austria four times, germany or spain\\nfive times, france six times, the british islands or italy ten times._\\nConceptions formed from the river-basins of Western Europe are rudely\\nshocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi;\\nnor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of\\nSiberia, the lofty plateaus of Central Asia, or the mighty sweep of\\nthe swampy Amazon more adequate. Latitude, elevation, and rainfall\\nall combine to render every part of the Mississippi Valley capable of\\nsupporting a dense population. _As a dwelling-place for civilized man it\\nis by far the first upon our globe_.\\n\\nEDITOR'S TABLE, HARPER'S MAGAZINE, FEBRUARY 1863\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 1\\n\\nThe River and Its History\\n\\nTHE Mississippi is well worth reading about. It is not a commonplace\\nriver, but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable. Considering the\\nMissouri its main branch, it is the longest river in the world--four\\nthousand three hundred miles. It seems safe to say that it is also the\\ncrookedest river in the world, since in one part of its journey it uses\\nup one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the\\ncrow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five. It discharges three\\ntimes as much water as the St. Lawrence, twenty-five times as much\\nas the Rhine, and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the\\nThames. No other river has so vast a drainage-basin: it draws its water\\nsupply from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, on the\\nAtlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that and Idaho on\\nthe Pacific slope--a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude. The\\nMississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four\\nsubordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats, and from some\\nhundreds that are navigable by flats and keels. The area of its\\ndrainage-basin is as great as the combined areas of England, Wales,\\nScotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy,\\nand Turkey; and almost all this wide region is fertile; the Mississippi\\nvalley, proper, is exceptionally so.\\n\\nIt is a remarkable river in this: that instead of widening toward its\\nmouth, it grows narrower; grows narrower and deeper. From the junction\\nof the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea, the width averages a\\nmile in high water: thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes,\\nuntil, at the 'Passes,' above the mouth, it is but little over half\\na mile. At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi's depth is\\neighty-seven feet; the depth increases gradually, reaching one hundred\\nand twenty-nine just above the mouth.\\n\\nThe difference in rise and fall is also remarkable--not in the upper,\\nbut in the lower river. The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez\\n(three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth)--about fifty feet.\\nBut at Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New\\nOrleans only fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and one half.\\n\\nAn article in the New Orleans 'Times-Democrat,' based upon reports of\\nable engineers, states that the river annually empties four hundred and\\nsix million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico--which brings to mind\\nCaptain Marryat's rude name for the Mississippi--'the Great Sewer.' This\\nmud, solidified, would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and\\nforty-one feet high.\\n\\nThe mud deposit gradually extends the land--but only gradually; it has\\nextended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which\\nhave elapsed since the river took its place in history. The belief of\\nthe scientific people is, that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge,\\nwhere the hills cease, and that the two hundred miles of land between\\nthere and the Gulf was built by the river. This gives us the age of that\\npiece of country, without any trouble at all--one hundred and twenty\\nthousand years. Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that\\nlies around there anywhere.\\n\\nThe Mississippi is remarkable in still another way--its disposition to\\nmake prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land, and thus\\nstraightening and shortening itself. More than once it has shortened\\nitself thirty miles at a single jump! These cut-offs have had curious\\neffects: they have thrown several river towns out into the rural\\ndistricts, and built up sand bars and forests in front of them. The town\\nof Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg: a recent cutoff has\\nradically changed the position, and Delta is now _two miles above_\\nVicksburg.\\n\\nBoth of these river towns have been retired to the country by that\\ncut-off. A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions:\\nfor instance, a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day, a\\ncut-off occurs to-night, and to-morrow the man finds himself and his\\nland over on the other side of the river, within the boundaries and\\nsubject to the laws of the State of Louisiana! Such a thing, happening\\nin the upper river in the old times, could have transferred a slave from\\nMissouri to Illinois and made a free man of him.\\n\\nThe Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone: it\\nis always changing its habitat _bodily_--is always moving bodily\\n_sidewise_. At Hard Times, La., the river is two miles west of the\\nregion it used to occupy. As a result, the original _site _of that\\nsettlement is not now in Louisiana at all, but on the other side of\\nthe river, in the State of Mississippi. _Nearly the whole of that one\\nthousand three hundred miles of old mississippi river which la salle\\nfloated down in his canoes, two hundred years ago, is good solid dry\\nground now_. The river lies to the right of it, in places, and to the\\nleft of it in other places.\\n\\nAlthough the Mississippi's mud builds land but slowly, down at the\\nmouth, where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work, it builds fast\\nenough in better protected regions higher up: for instance, Prophet's\\nIsland contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years\\nago; since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it.\\n\\nBut enough of these examples of the mighty stream's eccentricities for\\nthe present--I will give a few more of them further along in the book.\\n\\nLet us drop the Mississippi's physical history, and say a word about its\\nhistorical history--so to speak. We can glance briefly at its slumbrous\\nfirst epoch in a couple of short chapters; at its second and wider-awake\\nepoch in a couple more; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good\\nmany succeeding chapters; and then talk about its comparatively tranquil\\npresent epoch in what shall be left of the book.\\n\\nThe world and the books are so accustomed to use, and over-use, the word\\n'new' in connection with our country, that we early get and permanently\\nretain the impression that there is nothing old about it. We do of\\ncourse know that there are several comparatively old dates in American\\nhistory, but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea, no\\ndistinct realization, of the stretch of time which they represent.\\nTo say that De Soto, the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi\\nRiver, saw it in 1542, is a remark which states a fact without\\ninterpreting it: it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset\\nby astronomical measurements, and cataloguing the colors by their\\nscientific names;--as a result, you get the bald fact of the sunset, but\\nyou don't see the sunset. It would have been better to paint a picture\\nof it.\\n\\nThe date 1542, standing by itself, means little or nothing to us; but\\nwhen one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it,\\nhe adds perspective and color, and then realizes that this is one of the\\nAmerican dates which is quite respectable for age.\\n\\nFor instance, when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man, less\\nthan a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis I.'s defeat at\\nPavia; the death of Raphael; the death of Bayard, _Sans Peur Et Sans\\nReproche_; the driving out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by\\nthe Turks; and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions,--the act\\nwhich began the Reformation. When De Soto took his glimpse of the river,\\nIgnatius Loyola was an obscure name; the order of the Jesuits was not\\nyet a year old; Michael Angelo's paint was not yet dry on the Last\\nJudgment in the Sistine Chapel; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born,\\nbut would be before the year closed. Catherine de Medici was a child;\\nElizabeth of England was not yet in her teens; Calvin, Benvenuto\\nCellini, and the Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame, and\\neach was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion; Margaret\\nof Navarre was writing the 'Heptameron' and some religious books,--the\\nfirst survives, the others are forgotten, wit and indelicacy being\\nsometimes better literature preservers than holiness; lax court morals\\nand the absurd chivalry business were in full feather, and the joust and\\nthe tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who\\ncould fight better than they could spell, while religion was the passion\\nof their ladies, and classifying their offspring into children of full\\nrank and children by brevet their pastime.\\n\\nIn fact, all around, religion was in a peculiarly blooming condition:\\nthe Council of Trent was being called; the Spanish Inquisition was\\nroasting, and racking, and burning, with a free hand; elsewhere on the\\ncontinent the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword\\nand fire; in England, Henry VIII. had suppressed the monasteries,\\nburnt Fisher and another bishop or two, and was getting his English\\nreformation and his harem effectively started. When De Soto stood on the\\nbanks of the Mississippi, it was still two years before Luther's death;\\neleven years before the burning of Servetus; thirty years before the St.\\nBartholomew slaughter; Rabelais was not yet published; 'Don Quixote' was\\nnot yet written; Shakespeare was not yet born; a hundred long years must\\nstill elapse before Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell.\\n\\nUnquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which\\nconsiderably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country, and\\ngives her a most respectable outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity.\\n\\nDe Soto merely glimpsed the river, then died and was buried in it by his\\npriests and soldiers. One would expect the priests and the soldiers\\nto multiply the river's dimensions by ten--the Spanish custom of the\\nday--and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it. On\\nthe contrary, their narratives when they reached home, did not excite\\nthat amount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites\\nduring a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days. One\\nmay 'sense' the interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it\\nup in this way: After De Soto glimpsed the river, a fraction short of\\na quarter of a century elapsed, and then Shakespeare was born; lived a\\ntrifle more than half a century, then died; and when he had been in his\\ngrave considerably more than half a century, the _second _white man saw\\nthe Mississippi. In our day we don't allow a hundred and thirty years to\\nelapse between glimpses of a marvel. If somebody should discover a creek\\nin the county next to the one that the North Pole is in, Europe and\\nAmerica would start fifteen costly expeditions thither: one to explore\\nthe creek, and the other fourteen to hunt for each other.\\n\\nFor more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements\\non our Atlantic coasts. These people were in intimate communication\\nwith the Indians: in the south the Spaniards were robbing, slaughtering,\\nenslaving and converting them; higher up, the English were trading beads\\nand blankets to them for a consideration, and throwing in civilization\\nand whiskey, 'for lagniappe;' and in Canada the French were schooling\\nthem in a rudimentary way, missionarying among them, and drawing whole\\npopulations of them at a time to Quebec, and later to Montreal, to buy\\nfurs of them. Necessarily, then, these various clusters of whites must\\nhave heard of the great river of the far west; and indeed, they did\\nhear of it vaguely,--so vaguely and indefinitely, that its course,\\nproportions, and locality were hardly even guessable. The mere\\nmysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled\\nexploration; but this did not occur. Apparently nobody happened to want\\nsuch a river, nobody needed it, nobody was curious about it; so, for\\na century and a half the Mississippi remained out of the market and\\nundisturbed. When De Soto found it, he was not hunting for a river, and\\nhad no present occasion for one; consequently he did not value it or\\neven take any particular notice of it.\\n\\nBut at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out\\nthat river and exploring it. It always happens that when a man seizes\\nupon a neglected and important idea, people inflamed with the same\\nnotion crop up all around. It happened so in this instance.\\n\\nNaturally the question suggests itself, Why did these people want the\\nriver now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations?\\nApparently it was because at this late day they thought they had\\ndiscovered a way to make it useful; for it had come to be believed\\nthat the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California, and therefore\\nafforded a short cut from Canada to China. Previously the supposition\\nhad been that it emptied into the Atlantic, or Sea of Virginia.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 2\\n\\nThe River and Its Explorers\\n\\nLA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges, and they were\\ngraciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory. Chief among\\nthem was the privilege to explore, far and wide, and build forts, and\\nstake out continents, and hand the same over to the king, and pay the\\nexpenses himself; receiving, in return, some little advantages of one\\nsort or another; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides. He spent\\nseveral years and about all of his money, in making perilous and painful\\ntrips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois,\\nbefore he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape\\nthat he could strike for the Mississippi.\\n\\nAnd meantime other parties had had better fortune. In 1673 Joliet the\\nmerchant, and Marquette the priest, crossed the country and reached the\\nbanks of the Mississippi. They went by way of the Great Lakes; and from\\nGreen Bay, in canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin. Marquette\\nhad solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that\\nif the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would\\nname it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all\\nexplorers traveled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four\\nwith him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of\\nmeat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other\\nrequisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint\\nchroniclers of the time phrased it, to 'explain hell to the savages.'\\n\\nOn the 17th of June, 1673, the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and\\ntheir five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the\\nMississippi. Mr. Parkman says: 'Before them a wide and rapid current\\ncoursed athwart their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick\\nin forests.' He continues: 'Turning southward, they paddled down the\\nstream, through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man.'\\n\\nA big cat-fish collided with Marquette's canoe, and startled him; and\\nreasonably enough, for he had been warned by the Indians that he was\\non a foolhardy journey, and even a fatal one, for the river contained\\na demon 'whose roar could be heard at a great distance, and who would\\nengulf them in the abyss where he dwelt.' I have seen a Mississippi\\ncat-fish that was more than six feet long, and weighed two hundred and\\nfifty pounds; and if Marquette's fish was the fellow to that one, he had\\na fair right to think the river's roaring demon was come.\\n\\n'At length the buffalo began to appear, grazing in herds on the great\\nprairies which then bordered the river; and Marquette describes the\\nfierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders\\nthrough the tangled mane which nearly blinded them.'\\n\\nThe voyagers moved cautiously: 'Landed at night and made a fire to cook\\ntheir evening meal; then extinguished it, embarked again, paddled some\\nway farther, and anchored in the stream, keeping a man on the watch till\\nmorning.'\\n\\nThey did this day after day and night after night; and at the end of two\\nweeks they had not seen a human being. The river was an awful solitude,\\nthen. And it is now, over most of its stretch.\\n\\nBut at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints\\nof men in the mud of the western bank--a Robinson Crusoe experience\\nwhich carries an electric shiver with it yet, when one stumbles on it in\\nprint. They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and\\npitiless as the river demon, and destroyed all comers without waiting\\nfor provocation; but no matter, Joliet and Marquette struck into the\\ncountry to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks. They found them, by\\nand by, and were hospitably received and well treated--if to be received\\nby an Indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear\\nat his level best is to be received hospitably; and if to be treated\\nabundantly to fish, porridge, and other game, including dog, and have\\nthese things forked into one's mouth by the ungloved fingers of Indians\\nis to be well treated. In the morning the chief and six hundred of his\\ntribesmen escorted the Frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly\\nfarewell.\\n\\nOn the rocks above the present city of Alton they found some rude and\\nfantastic Indian paintings, which they describe. A short distance below\\n'a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current\\nof the Mississippi, boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs,\\nbranches, and uprooted trees.' This was the mouth of the Missouri, 'that\\nsavage river,' which 'descending from its mad career through a vast\\nunknown of barbarism, poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its\\ngentle sister.'\\n\\nBy and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio; they passed cane-brakes;\\nthey fought mosquitoes; they floated along, day after day, through the\\ndeep silence and loneliness of the river, drowsing in the scant shade\\nof makeshift awnings, and broiling with the heat; they encountered and\\nexchanged civilities with another party of Indians; and at last\\nthey reached the mouth of the Arkansas (about a month out from their\\nstarting-point), where a tribe of war-whooping savages swarmed out to\\nmeet and murder them; but they appealed to the Virgin for help; so in\\nplace of a fight there was a feast, and plenty of pleasant palaver and\\nfol-de-rol.\\n\\nThey had proved to their satisfaction, that the Mississippi did not\\nempty into the Gulf of California, or into the Atlantic. They believed\\nit emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. They turned back, now, and carried\\ntheir great news to Canada.\\n\\nBut belief is not proof. It was reserved for La Salle to furnish the\\nproof. He was provokingly delayed, by one misfortune after another, but\\nat last got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681. In the\\ndead of winter he and Henri de Tonty, son of Lorenzo Tonty, who invented\\nthe tontine, his lieutenant, started down the Illinois, with a\\nfollowing of eighteen Indians brought from New England, and twenty-three\\nFrenchmen. They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen\\nriver, on foot, and dragging their canoes after them on sledges.\\n\\nAt Peoria Lake they struck open water, and paddled thence to the\\nMississippi and turned their prows southward. They plowed through the\\nfields of floating ice, past the mouth of the Missouri; past the mouth\\nof the Ohio, by-and-by; 'and, gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp,\\nlanded on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs,' where\\nthey halted and built Fort Prudhomme.\\n\\n'Again,' says Mr. Parkman, 'they embarked; and with every stage of their\\nadventurous progress, the mystery of this vast new world was more and\\nmore unveiled. More and more they entered the realms of spring. The\\nhazy sunlight, the warm and drowsy air, the tender foliage, the opening\\nflowers, betokened the reviving life of nature.'\\n\\nDay by day they floated down the great bends, in the shadow of the dense\\nforests, and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas. First, they\\nwere greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before\\nbeen greeted by them--with the booming of the war drum and the flourish\\nof arms. The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquette's case; the\\npipe of peace did the same office for La Salle. The white man and the\\nred man struck hands and entertained each other during three days. Then,\\nto the admiration of the savages, La Salle set up a cross with the\\narms of France on it, and took possession of the whole country for the\\nking--the cool fashion of the time--while the priest piously consecrated\\nthe robbery with a hymn. The priest explained the mysteries of the faith\\n'by signs,' for the saving of the savages; thus compensating them with\\npossible possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they\\nhad just been robbed of. And also, by signs, La Salle drew from these\\nsimple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the\\nPutrid, over the water. Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies.\\n\\nThese performances took place on the site of the future town of\\nNapoleon, Arkansas, and there the first confiscation-cross was raised\\non the banks of the great river. Marquette's and Joliet's voyage\\nof discovery ended at the same spot--the site of the future town of\\nNapoleon. When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back\\nin the dim early days, he took it from that same spot--the site of the\\nfuture town of Napoleon, Arkansas. Therefore, three out of the four\\nmemorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the\\nmighty river, occurred, by accident, in one and the same place. It is a\\nmost curious distinction, when one comes to look at it and think about\\nit. France stole that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon;\\nand by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back again!--make\\nrestitution, not to the owners, but to their white American heirs.\\n\\nThe voyagers journeyed on, touching here and there; 'passed the sites,\\nsince become historic, of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf,' and visited an\\nimposing Indian monarch in the Teche country, whose capital city was a\\nsubstantial one of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw--better houses than\\nmany that exist there now. The chiefs house contained an audience room\\nforty feet square; and there he received Tonty in State, surrounded by\\nsixty old men clothed in white cloaks. There was a temple in the town,\\nwith a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to\\nthe sun.\\n\\nThe voyagers visited the Natchez Indians, near the site of the\\npresent city of that name, where they found a 'religious and political\\ndespotism, a privileged class descended from the sun, a temple and a\\nsacred fire.' It must have been like getting home again; it was home\\nwith an advantage, in fact, for it lacked Louis XIV.\\n\\nA few more days swept swiftly by, and La Salle stood in the shadow of\\nhis confiscating cross, at the meeting of the waters from Delaware, and\\nfrom Itaska, and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific,\\nwith the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, his task finished, his prodigy\\nachieved. Mr. Parkman, in closing his fascinating narrative, thus sums\\nup:\\n\\n'On that day, the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous\\naccession. The fertile plains of Texas; the vast basin of the\\nMississippi, from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of\\nthe Gulf; from the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks\\nof the Rocky Mountains--a region of savannas and forests, sun-cracked\\ndeserts and grassy prairies, watered by a thousand rivers, ranged by\\na thousand warlike tribes, passed beneath the scepter of the Sultan of\\nVersailles; and all by virtue of a feeble human voice, inaudible at half\\na mile.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 3\\n\\nFrescoes from the Past\\n\\nAPPARENTLY the river was ready for business, now. But no, the\\ndistribution of a population along its banks was as calm and deliberate\\nand time-devouring a process as the discovery and exploration had been.\\n\\nSeventy years elapsed, after the exploration, before the river's borders\\nhad a white population worth considering; and nearly fifty more before\\nthe river had a commerce. Between La Salle's opening of the river and\\nthe time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like\\na regular and active commerce, seven sovereigns had occupied the throne\\nof England, America had become an independent nation, Louis XIV. and\\nLouis XV. had rotted and died, the French monarchy had gone down in\\nthe red tempest of the revolution, and Napoleon was a name that was\\nbeginning to be talked about. Truly, there were snails in those days.\\n\\nThe river's earliest commerce was in great barges--keelboats,\\nbroadhorns. They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New\\nOrleans, changed cargoes there, and were tediously warped and poled back\\nby hand. A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months. In time\\nthis commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and\\nhardy men; rude, uneducated, brave, suffering terrific hardships with\\nsailor-like stoicism; heavy drinkers, coarse frolickers in moral sties\\nlike the Natchez-under-the-hill of that day, heavy fighters, reckless\\nfellows, every one, elephantinely jolly, foul-witted, profane; prodigal\\nof their money, bankrupt at the end of the trip, fond of barbaric\\nfinery, prodigious braggarts; yet, in the main, honest, trustworthy,\\nfaithful to promises and duty, and often picturesquely magnanimous.\\n\\nBy and by the steamboat intruded. Then for fifteen or twenty years,\\nthese men continued to run their keelboats down-stream, and the steamers\\ndid all of the upstream business, the keelboatmen selling their boats in\\nNew Orleans, and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.\\n\\nBut after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed\\nthat they were able to absorb the entire commerce; and then keelboating\\ndied a permanent death. The keelboatman became a deck hand, or a mate,\\nor a pilot on the steamer; and when steamer-berths were not open to him,\\nhe took a berth on a Pittsburgh coal-flat, or on a pine-raft constructed\\nin the forests up toward the sources of the Mississippi.\\n\\nIn the heyday of the steamboating prosperity, the river from end to end\\nwas flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts, all managed by hand,\\nand employing hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to\\ndescribe. I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used\\nto glide by Hannibal when I was a boy,--an acre or so of white,\\nsweet-smelling boards in each raft, a crew of two dozen men or more,\\nthree or four wigwams scattered about the raft's vast level space for\\nstorm-quarters,--and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk\\nof their big crews, the ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning\\nsuccessors; for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get\\non these rafts and have a ride.\\n\\nBy way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners, and that now-departed\\nand hardly-remembered raft-life, I will throw in, in this place, a\\nchapter from a book which I have been working at, by fits and starts,\\nduring the past five or six years, and may possibly finish in the course\\nof five or six more. The book is a story which details some passages in\\nthe life of an ignorant village boy, Huck Finn, son of the town drunkard\\nof my time out west, there. He has run away from his persecuting\\nfather, and from a persecuting good widow who wishes to make a nice,\\ntruth-telling, respectable boy of him; and with him a slave of the\\nwidow's has also escaped. They have found a fragment of a lumber raft\\n(it is high water and dead summer time), and are floating down the river\\nby night, and hiding in the willows by day,--bound for Cairo,--whence\\nthe negro will seek freedom in the heart of the free States. But in a\\nfog, they pass Cairo without knowing it. By and by they begin to suspect\\nthe truth, and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal suspense by\\nswimming down to a huge raft which they have seen in the distance ahead\\nof them, creeping aboard under cover of the darkness, and gathering the\\nneeded information by eavesdropping:--\\n\\nBut you know a young person can't wait very well when he is impatient to\\nfind a thing out. We talked it over, and by and by Jim said it was such\\na black night, now, that it wouldn't be no risk to swim down to the big\\nraft and crawl aboard and listen--they would talk about Cairo, because\\nthey would be calculating to go ashore there for a spree, maybe, or\\nanyway they would send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or\\nsomething. Jim had a wonderful level head, for a nigger: he could most\\nalways start a good plan when you wanted one.\\n\\nI stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river, and struck\\nout for the raft's light. By and by, when I got down nearly to her,\\nI eased up and went slow and cautious. But everything was all\\nright--nobody at the sweeps. So I swum down along the raft till I was\\nmost abreast the camp fire in the middle, then I crawled aboard and\\ninched along and got in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather\\nside of the fire. There was thirteen men there--they was the watch on\\ndeck of course. And a mighty rough-looking lot, too. They had a jug, and\\ntin cups, and they kept the jug moving. One man was singing--roaring,\\nyou may say; and it wasn't a nice song--for a parlor anyway. He roared\\nthrough his nose, and strung out the last word of every line very long.\\nWhen he was done they all fetched a kind of Injun war-whoop, and then\\nanother was sung. It begun:--\\n\\n'There was a woman in our towdn, In our towdn did dwed'l (dwell,) She\\nloved her husband dear-i-lee, But another man twysteas wed'l.\\n\\nSinging too, riloo, riloo, riloo, Ri-too, riloo, rilay--She loved her\\nhusband dear-i-lee, But another man twyste as wed'l.\\n\\nAnd so on--fourteen verses. It was kind of poor, and when he was going\\nto start on the next verse one of them said it was the tune the old cow\\ndied on; and another one said, 'Oh, give us a rest.' And another one\\ntold him to take a walk. They made fun of him till he got mad and jumped\\nup and begun to cuss the crowd, and said he could lame any thief in the\\nlot.\\n\\nThey was all about to make a break for him, but the biggest man there\\njumped up and says--\\n\\n'Set whar you are, gentlemen. Leave him to me; he's my meat.'\\n\\nThen he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels together\\nevery time. He flung off a buckskin coat that was all hung with fringes,\\nand says, 'You lay thar tell the chawin-up's done;' and flung his hat\\ndown, which was all over ribbons, and says, 'You lay thar tell his\\nsufferin's is over.'\\n\\nThen he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together again and\\nshouted out--\\n\\n'Whoo-oop! I'm the old original iron-jawed, brass-mounted,\\ncopper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw!--Look at me!\\nI'm the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation! Sired by a\\nhurricane, dam'd by an earthquake, half-brother to the cholera, nearly\\nrelated to the small-pox on the mother's side! Look at me! I take\\nnineteen alligators and a bar'l of whiskey for breakfast when I'm in\\nrobust health, and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I'm\\nailing! I split the everlasting rocks with my glance, and I squench the\\nthunder when I speak! Whoo-oop! Stand back and give me room according\\nto my strength! Blood's my natural drink, and the wails of the dying is\\nmusic to my ear! Cast your eye on me, gentlemen!--and lay low and hold\\nyour breath, for I'm bout to turn myself loose!'\\n\\nAll the time he was getting this off, he was shaking his head and\\nlooking fierce, and kind of swelling around in a little circle, tucking\\nup his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating his\\nbreast with his fist, saying, 'Look at me, gentlemen!' When he got\\nthrough, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, and\\nlet off a roaring 'Whoo-oop! I'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that\\nlives!'\\n\\nThen the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down\\nover his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back sagged\\nand his south end sticking out far, and his fists a-shoving out and\\ndrawing in in front of him, and so went around in a little circle\\nabout three times, swelling himself up and breathing hard. Then he\\nstraightened, and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times,\\nbefore he lit again (that made them cheer), and he begun to shout like\\nthis--\\n\\n'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the kingdom of sorrow's\\na-coming! Hold me down to the earth, for I feel my powers a-working!\\nwhoo-oop! I'm a child of sin, don't let me get a start! Smoked\\nglass, here, for all! Don't attempt to look at me with the naked\\neye, gentlemen! When I'm playful I use the meridians of longitude and\\nparallels of latitude for a seine, and drag the Atlantic Ocean for\\nwhales! I scratch my head with the lightning, and purr myself to sleep\\nwith the thunder! When I'm cold, I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe\\nin it; when I'm hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm; when I'm\\nthirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge; when I range the\\nearth hungry, famine follows in my tracks! Whoo-oop! Bow your neck and\\nspread! I put my hand on the sun's face and make it night in the earth;\\nI bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons; I shake myself\\nand crumble the mountains! Contemplate me through leather--don't use the\\nnaked eye! I'm the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The\\nmassacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments,\\nthe destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life! The\\nboundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property,\\nand I bury my dead on my own premises!' He jumped up and cracked his\\nheels together three times before he lit (they cheered him again), and\\nas he come down he shouted out: 'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for\\nthe pet child of calamity's a-coming!'\\n\\nThen the other one went to swelling around and blowing again--the first\\none--the one they called Bob; next, the Child of Calamity chipped in\\nagain, bigger than ever; then they both got at it at the same time,\\nswelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into\\neach other's faces, and whooping and jawing like Injuns; then Bob called\\nthe Child names, and the Child called him names back again: next, Bob\\ncalled him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with the\\nvery worst kind of language; next, Bob knocked the Child's hat off, and\\nthe Child picked it up and kicked Bob's ribbony hat about six foot; Bob\\nwent and got it and said never mind, this warn't going to be the last\\nof this thing, because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive,\\nand so the Child better look out, for there was a time a-coming, just\\nas sure as he was a living man, that he would have to answer to him with\\nthe best blood in his body. The Child said no man was willinger than\\nhe was for that time to come, and he would give Bob fair warning, now,\\nnever to cross his path again, for he could never rest till he had waded\\nin his blood, for such was his nature, though he was sparing him now on\\naccount of his family, if he had one.\\n\\nBoth of them was edging away in different directions, growling and\\nshaking their heads and going on about what they was going to do; but a\\nlittle black-whiskered chap skipped up and says--\\n\\n'Come back here, you couple of chicken-livered cowards, and I'll thrash\\nthe two of ye!'\\n\\nAnd he done it, too. He snatched them, he jerked them this way and that,\\nhe booted them around, he knocked them sprawling faster than they could\\nget up. Why, it warn't two minutes till they begged like dogs--and\\nhow the other lot did yell and laugh and clap their hands all the way\\nthrough, and shout 'Sail in, Corpse-Maker!' 'Hi! at him again, Child of\\nCalamity!' 'Bully for you, little Davy!' Well, it was a perfect pow-wow\\nfor a while. Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes when they\\ngot through. Little Davy made them own up that they were sneaks and\\ncowards and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a nigger; then Bob\\nand the Child shook hands with each other, very solemn, and said they\\nhad always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be\\nbygones. So then they washed their faces in the river; and just then\\nthere was a loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of them went\\nforward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft to handle the\\nafter-sweeps.\\n\\nI laid still and waited for fifteen minutes, and had a smoke out of a\\npipe that one of them left in reach; then the crossing was finished, and\\nthey stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking and singing\\nagain. Next they got out an old fiddle, and one played and another\\npatted juba, and the rest turned themselves loose on a regular\\nold-fashioned keel-boat break-down. They couldn't keep that up very long\\nwithout getting winded, so by and by they settled around the jug again.\\n\\nThey sung 'jolly, jolly raftman's the life for me,' with a rousing\\nchorus, and then they got to talking about differences betwixt hogs, and\\ntheir different kind of habits; and next about women and their different\\nways: and next about the best ways to put out houses that was afire; and\\nnext about what ought to be done with the Injuns; and next about what\\na king had to do, and how much he got; and next about how to make cats\\nfight; and next about what to do when a man has fits; and next about\\ndifferences betwixt clear-water rivers and muddy-water ones. The man\\nthey called Ed said the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to drink\\nthan the clear water of the Ohio; he said if you let a pint of this\\nyaller Mississippi water settle, you would have about a half to\\nthree-quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom, according to the stage\\nof the river, and then it warn't no better than Ohio water--what you\\nwanted to do was to keep it stirred up--and when the river was low, keep\\nmud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the way it ought to be.\\n\\nThe Child of Calamity said that was so; he said there was nutritiousness\\nin the mud, and a man that drunk Mississippi water could grow corn in\\nhis stomach if he wanted to. He says--\\n\\n'You look at the graveyards; that tells the tale. Trees won't grow worth\\nchucks in a Cincinnati graveyard, but in a Sent Louis graveyard they\\ngrow upwards of eight hundred foot high. It's all on account of the\\nwater the people drunk before they laid up. A Cincinnati corpse don't\\nrichen a soil any.'\\n\\nAnd they talked about how Ohio water didn't like to mix with Mississippi\\nwater. Ed said if you take the Mississippi on a rise when the Ohio is\\nlow, you'll find a wide band of clear water all the way down the east\\nside of the Mississippi for a hundred mile or more, and the minute you\\nget out a quarter of a mile from shore and pass the line, it is all\\nthick and yaller the rest of the way across. Then they talked about how\\nto keep tobacco from getting moldy, and from that they went into ghosts\\nand told about a lot that other folks had seen; but Ed says--\\n\\n'Why don't you tell something that you've seen yourselves? Now let me\\nhave a say. Five years ago I was on a raft as big as this, and right\\nalong here it was a bright moonshiny night, and I was on watch and boss\\nof the stabboard oar forrard, and one of my pards was a man named Dick\\nAllbright, and he come along to where I was sitting, forrard--gaping and\\nstretching, he was--and stooped down on the edge of the raft and washed\\nhis face in the river, and come and set down by me and got out his pipe,\\nand had just got it filled, when he looks up and says--\\n\\n'“Why looky-here,” he says, “ain't that Buck Miller's place, over yander\\nin the bend.”\\n\\n'“Yes,” says I, “it is--why.” He laid his pipe down and leant his head\\non his hand, and says--\\n\\n'“I thought we'd be furder down.” I says--\\n\\n'“I thought it too, when I went off watch”--we was standing six hours on\\nand six off--“but the boys told me,” I says, “that the raft didn't seem\\nto hardly move, for the last hour,” says I, “though she's a slipping\\nalong all right, now,” says I. He give a kind of a groan, and says--\\n\\n'“I've seed a raft act so before, along here,” he says, “'pears to me\\nthe current has most quit above the head of this bend durin' the last\\ntwo years,” he says.\\n\\n'Well, he raised up two or three times, and looked away off and around\\non the water. That started me at it, too. A body is always doing what he\\nsees somebody else doing, though there mayn't be no sense in it. Pretty\\nsoon I see a black something floating on the water away off to stabboard\\nand quartering behind us. I see he was looking at it, too. I says--\\n\\n'“What's that?” He says, sort of pettish,--\\n\\n'“Tain't nothing but an old empty bar'l.”\\n\\n'“An empty bar'l!” says I, “why,” says I, “a spy-glass is a fool to your\\neyes. How can you tell it's an empty bar'l?” He says--\\n\\n'“I don't know; I reckon it ain't a bar'l, but I thought it might be,”\\n says he.\\n\\n'“Yes,” I says, “so it might be, and it might be anything else, too; a\\nbody can't tell nothing about it, such a distance as that,” I says.\\n\\n'We hadn't nothing else to do, so we kept on watching it. By and by I\\nsays--\\n\\n'“Why looky-here, Dick Allbright, that thing's a-gaining on us, I\\nbelieve.”\\n\\n'He never said nothing. The thing gained and gained, and I judged it\\nmust be a dog that was about tired out. Well, we swung down into\\nthe crossing, and the thing floated across the bright streak of the\\nmoonshine, and, by George, it was bar'l. Says I--\\n\\n'“Dick Allbright, what made you think that thing was a bar'l, when it\\nwas a half a mile off,” says I. Says he--\\n\\n'“I don't know.” Says I--\\n\\n'“You tell me, Dick Allbright.” He says--\\n\\n'“Well, I knowed it was a bar'l; I've seen it before; lots has seen it;\\nthey says it's a haunted bar'l.”\\n\\n'I called the rest of the watch, and they come and stood there, and\\nI told them what Dick said. It floated right along abreast, now, and\\ndidn't gain any more. It was about twenty foot off. Some was for having\\nit aboard, but the rest didn't want to. Dick Allbright said rafts that\\nhad fooled with it had got bad luck by it. The captain of the watch\\nsaid he didn't believe in it. He said he reckoned the bar'l gained on us\\nbecause it was in a little better current than what we was. He said it\\nwould leave by and by.\\n\\n'So then we went to talking about other things, and we had a song, and\\nthen a breakdown; and after that the captain of the watch called for\\nanother song; but it was clouding up, now, and the bar'l stuck right\\nthar in the same place, and the song didn't seem to have much warm-up to\\nit, somehow, and so they didn't finish it, and there warn't any cheers,\\nbut it sort of dropped flat, and nobody said anything for a minute. Then\\neverybody tried to talk at once, and one chap got off a joke, but it\\nwarn't no use, they didn't laugh, and even the chap that made the joke\\ndidn't laugh at it, which ain't usual. We all just settled down glum,\\nand watched the bar'l, and was oneasy and oncomfortable. Well, sir, it\\nshut down black and still, and then the wind begin to moan around, and\\nnext the lightning begin to play and the thunder to grumble. And pretty\\nsoon there was a regular storm, and in the middle of it a man that was\\nrunning aft stumbled and fell and sprained his ankle so that he had\\nto lay up. This made the boys shake their heads. And every time the\\nlightning come, there was that bar'l with the blue lights winking around\\nit. We was always on the look-out for it. But by and by, towards dawn,\\nshe was gone. When the day come we couldn't see her anywhere, and we\\nwarn't sorry, neither.\\n\\n'But next night about half-past nine, when there was songs and high\\njinks going on, here she comes again, and took her old roost on the\\nstabboard side. There warn't no more high jinks. Everybody got solemn;\\nnobody talked; you couldn't get anybody to do anything but set around\\nmoody and look at the bar'l. It begun to cloud up again. When the watch\\nchanged, the off watch stayed up, 'stead of turning in. The storm ripped\\nand roared around all night, and in the middle of it another man tripped\\nand sprained his ankle, and had to knock off. The bar'l left towards\\nday, and nobody see it go.\\n\\n'Everybody was sober and down in the mouth all day. I don't mean the\\nkind of sober that comes of leaving liquor alone--not that. They was\\nquiet, but they all drunk more than usual--not together--but each man\\nsidled off and took it private, by himself.\\n\\n'After dark the off watch didn't turn in; nobody sung, nobody talked;\\nthe boys didn't scatter around, neither; they sort of huddled together,\\nforrard; and for two hours they set there, perfectly still, looking\\nsteady in the one direction, and heaving a sigh once in a while. And\\nthen, here comes the bar'l again. She took up her old place. She staid\\nthere all night; nobody turned in. The storm come on again, after\\nmidnight. It got awful dark; the rain poured down; hail, too; the\\nthunder boomed and roared and bellowed; the wind blowed a hurricane; and\\nthe lightning spread over everything in big sheets of glare, and showed\\nthe whole raft as plain as day; and the river lashed up white as milk\\nas far as you could see for miles, and there was that bar'l jiggering\\nalong, same as ever. The captain ordered the watch to man the after\\nsweeps for a crossing, and nobody would go--no more sprained ankles for\\nthem, they said. They wouldn't even walk aft. Well then, just then the\\nsky split wide open, with a crash, and the lightning killed two men of\\nthe after watch, and crippled two more. Crippled them how, says you?\\nWhy, sprained their ankles!\\n\\n'The bar'l left in the dark betwixt lightnings, towards dawn. Well, not\\na body eat a bite at breakfast that morning. After that the men loafed\\naround, in twos and threes, and talked low together. But none of them\\nherded with Dick Allbright. They all give him the cold shake. If he come\\naround where any of the men was, they split up and sidled away. They\\nwouldn't man the sweeps with him. The captain had all the skiffs hauled\\nup on the raft, alongside of his wigwam, and wouldn't let the dead men\\nbe took ashore to be planted; he didn't believe a man that got ashore\\nwould come back; and he was right.\\n\\n'After night come, you could see pretty plain that there was going to be\\ntrouble if that bar'l come again; there was such a muttering going on. A\\ngood many wanted to kill Dick Allbright, because he'd seen the bar'l on\\nother trips, and that had an ugly look. Some wanted to put him ashore.\\nSome said, let's all go ashore in a pile, if the bar'l comes again.\\n\\n'This kind of whispers was still going on, the men being bunched\\ntogether forrard watching for the bar'l, when, lo and behold you, here\\nshe comes again. Down she comes, slow and steady, and settles into her\\nold tracks. You could a heard a pin drop. Then up comes the captain, and\\nsays:--\\n\\n'“Boys, don't be a pack of children and fools; I don't want this bar'l\\nto be dogging us all the way to Orleans, and _you _don't; well, then,\\nhow's the best way to stop it? Burn it up,--that's the way. I'm going\\nto fetch it aboard,” he says. And before anybody could say a word, in he\\nwent.\\n\\n'He swum to it, and as he come pushing it to the raft, the men spread\\nto one side. But the old man got it aboard and busted in the head,\\nand there was a baby in it! Yes, sir, a stark naked baby. It was Dick\\nAllbright's baby; he owned up and said so.\\n\\n'“Yes,” he says, a-leaning over it, “yes, it is my own lamented darling,\\nmy poor lost Charles William Allbright deceased,” says he,--for he could\\ncurl his tongue around the bulliest words in the language when he was a\\nmind to, and lay them before you without a jint started, anywheres. Yes,\\nhe said he used to live up at the head of this bend, and one night he\\nchoked his child, which was crying, not intending to kill it,--which was\\nprob'ly a lie,--and then he was scared, and buried it in a bar'l, before\\nhis wife got home, and off he went, and struck the northern trail and\\nwent to rafting; and this was the third year that the bar'l had chased\\nhim. He said the bad luck always begun light, and lasted till four men\\nwas killed, and then the bar'l didn't come any more after that. He\\nsaid if the men would stand it one more night,--and was a-going on like\\nthat,--but the men had got enough. They started to get out a boat to\\ntake him ashore and lynch him, but he grabbed the little child all of a\\nsudden and jumped overboard with it hugged up to his breast and shedding\\ntears, and we never see him again in this life, poor old suffering soul,\\nnor Charles William neither.'\\n\\n'_Who _was shedding tears?' says Bob; 'was it Allbright or the baby?'\\n\\n'Why, Allbright, of course; didn't I tell you the baby was dead. Been\\ndead three years--how could it cry?'\\n\\n'Well, never mind how it could cry--how could it _keep _all that time?'\\nsays Davy. 'You answer me that.'\\n\\n'I don't know how it done it,' says Ed. 'It done it though--that's all I\\nknow about it.'\\n\\n'Say--what did they do with the bar'l?' says the Child of Calamity.\\n\\n'Why, they hove it overboard, and it sunk like a chunk of lead.'\\n\\n'Edward, did the child look like it was choked?' says one.\\n\\n'Did it have its hair parted?' says another.\\n\\n'What was the brand on that bar'l, Eddy?' says a fellow they called\\nBill.\\n\\n'Have you got the papers for them statistics, Edmund?' says Jimmy.\\n\\n'Say, Edwin, was you one of the men that was killed by the lightning.'\\nsays Davy.\\n\\n'Him? O, no, he was both of 'em,' says Bob. Then they all haw-hawed.\\n\\n'Say, Edward, don't you reckon you'd better take a pill? You look\\nbad--don't you feel pale?' says the Child of Calamity.\\n\\n'O, come, now, Eddy,' says Jimmy, 'show up; you must a kept part of that\\nbar'l to prove the thing by. Show us the bunghole--do--and we'll all\\nbelieve you.'\\n\\n'Say, boys,' says Bill, 'less divide it up. Thar's thirteen of us. I can\\nswaller a thirteenth of the yarn, if you can worry down the rest.'\\n\\nEd got up mad and said they could all go to some place which he ripped\\nout pretty savage, and then walked off aft cussing to himself, and they\\nyelling and jeering at him, and roaring and laughing so you could hear\\nthem a mile.\\n\\n'Boys, we'll split a watermelon on that,' says the Child of Calamity;\\nand he come rummaging around in the dark amongst the shingle bundles\\nwhere I was, and put his hand on me. I was warm and soft and naked; so\\nhe says 'Ouch!' and jumped back.\\n\\n'Fetch a lantern or a chunk of fire here, boys--there's a snake here as\\nbig as a cow!'\\n\\nSo they run there with a lantern and crowded up and looked in on me.\\n\\n'Come out of that, you beggar!' says one.\\n\\n'Who are you?' says another.\\n\\n'What are you after here? Speak up prompt, or overboard you go.\\n\\n'Snake him out, boys. Snatch him out by the heels.'\\n\\nI began to beg, and crept out amongst them trembling. They looked me\\nover, wondering, and the Child of Calamity says--\\n\\n'A cussed thief! Lend a hand and less heave him overboard!'\\n\\n'No,' says Big Bob, 'less get out the paint-pot and paint him a sky blue\\nall over from head to heel, and then heave him over!'\\n\\n'Good, that 's it. Go for the paint, Jimmy.'\\n\\nWhen the paint come, and Bob took the brush and was just going to begin,\\nthe others laughing and rubbing their hands, I begun to cry, and that\\nsort of worked on Davy, and he says--\\n\\n''Vast there! He 's nothing but a cub. 'I'll paint the man that tetches\\nhim!'\\n\\nSo I looked around on them, and some of them grumbled and growled, and\\nBob put down the paint, and the others didn't take it up.\\n\\n'Come here to the fire, and less see what you're up to here,' says Davy.\\n'Now set down there and give an account of yourself. How long have you\\nbeen aboard here?'\\n\\n'Not over a quarter of a minute, sir,' says I.\\n\\n'How did you get dry so quick?'\\n\\n'I don't know, sir. I'm always that way, mostly.'\\n\\n'Oh, you are, are you. What's your name?'\\n\\nI warn't going to tell my name. I didn't know what to say, so I just\\nsays--\\n\\n'Charles William Allbright, sir.'\\n\\nThen they roared--the whole crowd; and I was mighty glad I said that,\\nbecause maybe laughing would get them in a better humor.\\n\\nWhen they got done laughing, Davy says--\\n\\n'It won't hardly do, Charles William. You couldn't have growed this much\\nin five year, and you was a baby when you come out of the bar'l, you\\nknow, and dead at that. Come, now, tell a straight story, and nobody'll\\nhurt you, if you ain't up to anything wrong. What _is_ your name?'\\n\\n'Aleck Hopkins, sir. Aleck James Hopkins.'\\n\\n'Well, Aleck, where did you come from, here?'\\n\\n'From a trading scow. She lays up the bend yonder. I was born on her.\\nPap has traded up and down here all his life; and he told me to swim off\\nhere, because when you went by he said he would like to get some of you\\nto speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner, in Cairo, and tell him--'\\n\\n'Oh, come!'\\n\\n'Yes, sir; it's as true as the world; Pap he says--'\\n\\n'Oh, your grandmother!'\\n\\nThey all laughed, and I tried again to talk, but they broke in on me and\\nstopped me.\\n\\n'Now, looky-here,' says Davy; 'you're scared, and so you talk wild.\\nHonest, now, do you live in a scow, or is it a lie?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir, in a trading scow. She lays up at the head of the bend. But I\\nwarn't born in her. It's our first trip.'\\n\\n'Now you're talking! What did you come aboard here, for? To steal?'\\n\\n'No, sir, I didn't.--It was only to get a ride on the raft. All boys\\ndoes that.'\\n\\n'Well, I know that. But what did you hide for?'\\n\\n'Sometimes they drive the boys off.'\\n\\n'So they do. They might steal. Looky-here; if we let you off this time,\\nwill you keep out of these kind of scrapes hereafter?'\\n\\n''Deed I will, boss. You try me.'\\n\\n'All right, then. You ain't but little ways from shore. Overboard with\\nyou, and don't you make a fool of yourself another time this way.--Blast\\nit, boy, some raftsmen would rawhide you till you were black and blue!'\\n\\nI didn't wait to kiss good-bye, but went overboard and broke for shore.\\nWhen Jim come along by and by, the big raft was away out of sight around\\nthe point. I swum out and got aboard, and was mighty glad to see home\\nagain.\\n\\nThe boy did not get the information he was after, but his adventure has\\nfurnished the glimpse of the departed raftsman and keelboatman which I\\ndesire to offer in this place.\\n\\nI now come to a phase of the Mississippi River life of the flush times\\nof steamboating, which seems to me to warrant full examination--the\\nmarvelous science of piloting, as displayed there. I believe there has\\nbeen nothing like it elsewhere in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 4\\n\\nThe Boys' Ambition\\n\\nWHEN I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades\\nin our village {footnote [1. Hannibal, Missouri]} on the west bank of\\nthe Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman. We had transient\\nambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a circus\\ncame and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first negro\\nminstrel show that came to our section left us all suffering to try that\\nkind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good,\\nGod would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in\\nits turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained.\\n\\nOnce a day a cheap, gaudy packet arrived upward from St. Louis, and\\nanother downward from Keokuk. Before these events, the day was glorious\\nwith expectancy; after them, the day was a dead and empty thing. Not\\nonly the boys, but the whole village, felt this. After all these years I\\ncan picture that old time to myself now, just as it was then: the white\\ntown drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morning; the streets empty,\\nor pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water\\nStreet stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against\\nthe wall, chins on breasts, hats slouched over their faces, asleep--with\\nshingle-shavings enough around to show what broke them down; a sow and\\na litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in\\nwatermelon rinds and seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles\\nscattered about the 'levee;' a pile of 'skids' on the slope of the\\nstone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow\\nof them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody to\\nlisten to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them; the great\\nMississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its\\nmile-wide tide along, shining in the sun; the dense forest away on the\\nother side; the 'point' above the town, and the 'point' below, bounding\\nthe river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of sea, and withal a very\\nstill and brilliant and lonely one. Presently a film of dark smoke\\nappears above one of those remote 'points;' instantly a negro drayman,\\nfamous for his quick eye and prodigious voice, lifts up the cry,\\n'S-t-e-a-m-boat a-comin'!' and the scene changes! The town drunkard\\nstirs, the clerks wake up, a furious clatter of drays follows, every\\nhouse and store pours out a human contribution, and all in a twinkling\\nthe dead town is alive and moving.\\n\\nDrays, carts, men, boys, all go hurrying from many quarters to a common\\ncenter, the wharf. Assembled there, the people fasten their eyes upon\\nthe coming boat as upon a wonder they are seeing for the first time. And\\nthe boat _is_ rather a handsome sight, too. She is long and sharp and\\ntrim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded\\ndevice of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilot-house, a glass\\nand 'gingerbread', perched on top of the 'texas' deck behind them; the\\npaddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the\\nboat's name; the boiler deck, the hurricane deck, and the texas deck\\nare fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag\\ngallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the\\nfires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the\\ncaptain stands by the big bell, calm, imposing, the envy of all; great\\nvolumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the\\nchimneys--a husbanded grandeur created with a bit of pitch pine just\\nbefore arriving at a town; the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the\\nbroad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deckhand\\nstands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand;\\nthe pent steam is screaming through the gauge-cocks, the captain lifts\\nhis hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then they turn back, churning\\nthe water to foam, and the steamer is at rest. Then such a scramble as\\nthere is to get aboard, and to get ashore, and to take in freight and to\\ndischarge freight, all at one and the same time; and such a yelling\\nand cursing as the mates facilitate it all with! Ten minutes later the\\nsteamer is under way again, with no flag on the jack-staff and no black\\nsmoke issuing from the chimneys. After ten more minutes the town is dead\\nagain, and the town drunkard asleep by the skids once more.\\n\\nMy father was a justice of the peace, and I supposed he possessed\\nthe power of life and death over all men and could hang anybody that\\noffended him. This was distinction enough for me as a general thing; but\\nthe desire to be a steamboatman kept intruding, nevertheless. I first\\nwanted to be a cabin-boy, so that I could come out with a white apron\\non and shake a tablecloth over the side, where all my old comrades could\\nsee me; later I thought I would rather be the deckhand who stood on the\\nend of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand, because he was\\nparticularly conspicuous. But these were only day-dreams,--they were too\\nheavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities. By and by one of our\\nboys went away. He was not heard of for a long time. At last he turned\\nup as apprentice engineer or 'striker' on a steamboat. This thing shook\\nthe bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings. That boy had been\\nnotoriously worldly, and I just the reverse; yet he was exalted to this\\neminence, and I left in obscurity and misery. There was nothing generous\\nabout this fellow in his greatness. He would always manage to have a\\nrusty bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at our town, and he would sit\\non the inside guard and scrub it, where we could all see him and envy\\nhim and loathe him. And whenever his boat was laid up he would come home\\nand swell around the town in his blackest and greasiest clothes, so that\\nnobody could help remembering that he was a steamboatman; and he used\\nall sorts of steamboat technicalities in his talk, as if he were so used\\nto them that he forgot common people could not understand them. He would\\nspeak of the 'labboard' side of a horse in an easy, natural way that\\nwould make one wish he was dead. And he was always talking about 'St.\\nLooy' like an old citizen; he would refer casually to occasions when\\nhe 'was coming down Fourth Street,' or when he was 'passing by the\\nPlanter's House,' or when there was a fire and he took a turn on the\\nbrakes of 'the old Big Missouri;' and then he would go on and lie about\\nhow many towns the size of ours were burned down there that day. Two\\nor three of the boys had long been persons of consideration among\\nus because they had been to St. Louis once and had a vague general\\nknowledge of its wonders, but the day of their glory was over now. They\\nlapsed into a humble silence, and learned to disappear when the ruthless\\n'cub'-engineer approached. This fellow had money, too, and hair oil.\\nAlso an ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watch chain. He wore\\na leather belt and used no suspenders. If ever a youth was cordially\\nadmired and hated by his comrades, this one was. No girl could withstand\\nhis charms. He 'cut out' every boy in the village. When his boat blew up\\nat last, it diffused a tranquil contentment among us such as we had not\\nknown for months. But when he came home the next week, alive, renowned,\\nand appeared in church all battered up and bandaged, a shining hero,\\nstared at and wondered over by everybody, it seemed to us that the\\npartiality of Providence for an undeserving reptile had reached a point\\nwhere it was open to criticism.\\n\\nThis creature's career could produce but one result, and it speedily\\nfollowed. Boy after boy managed to get on the river. The minister's son\\nbecame an engineer. The doctor's and the post-master's sons became 'mud\\nclerks;' the wholesale liquor dealer's son became a barkeeper on a\\nboat; four sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of the county judge,\\nbecame pilots. Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even\\nin those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary--from a hundred\\nand fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay.\\nTwo months of his wages would pay a preacher's salary for a year. Now\\nsome of us were left disconsolate. We could not get on the river--at\\nleast our parents would not let us.\\n\\nSo by and by I ran away. I said I never would come home again till I was\\na pilot and could come in glory. But somehow I could not manage it.\\nI went meekly aboard a few of the boats that lay packed together like\\nsardines at the long St. Louis wharf, and very humbly inquired for the\\npilots, but got only a cold shoulder and short words from mates and\\nclerks. I had to make the best of this sort of treatment for the time\\nbeing, but I had comforting daydreams of a future when I should be a\\ngreat and honored pilot, with plenty of money, and could kill some of\\nthese mates and clerks and pay for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 5\\n\\nI Want to be a Cub-pilot\\n\\nMONTHS afterward the hope within me struggled to a reluctant death, and\\nI found myself without an ambition. But I was ashamed to go home. I was\\nin Cincinnati, and I set to work to map out a new career. I had\\nbeen reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an\\nexpedition sent out by our government. It was said that the expedition,\\nowing to difficulties, had not thoroughly explored a part of the country\\nlying about the head-waters, some four thousand miles from the mouth of\\nthe river. It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to\\nNew Orleans, where I could doubtless get a ship. I had thirty dollars\\nleft; I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon. This was\\nall the thought I gave to the subject. I never was great in matters of\\ndetail. I packed my valise, and took passage on an ancient tub called\\nthe 'Paul Jones,' for New Orleans. For the sum of sixteen dollars I had\\nthe scarred and tarnished splendors of 'her' main saloon principally\\nto myself, for she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser\\ntravelers.\\n\\nWhen we presently got under way and went poking down the broad Ohio,\\nI became a new being, and the subject of my own admiration. I was a\\ntraveler! A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before. I had an\\nexultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes\\nwhich I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such a\\nglorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I\\nwas able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had\\nhardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, when we stopped at villages and\\nwood-yards, I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the\\nboiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank. If\\nthey did not seem to discover me, I presently sneezed to attract their\\nattention, or moved to a position where they could not help seeing me.\\nAnd as soon as I knew they saw me I gaped and stretched, and gave other\\nsigns of being mightily bored with traveling.\\n\\nI kept my hat off all the time, and stayed where the wind and the sun\\ncould strike me, because I wanted to get the bronzed and weather-beaten\\nlook of an old traveler. Before the second day was half gone I\\nexperienced a joy which filled me with the purest gratitude; for I saw\\nthat the skin had begun to blister and peel off my face and neck. I\\nwished that the boys and girls at home could see me now.\\n\\nWe reached Louisville in time--at least the neighborhood of it. We stuck\\nhard and fast on the rocks in the middle of the river, and lay there\\nfour days. I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part\\nof the boat's family, a sort of infant son to the captain and younger\\nbrother to the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this\\ngrandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those\\npeople. I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort\\nof presumption in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to acquire the\\nleast trifle of notice from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert\\nfor an opportunity to do him a service to that end. It came at last. The\\nriotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the forecastle,\\nand I went down there and stood around in the way--or mostly skipping\\nout of it--till the mate suddenly roared a general order for somebody to\\nbring him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said: 'Tell me where\\nit is--I'll fetch it!'\\n\\nIf a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for the Emperor\\nof Russia, the monarch could not have been more astounded than the mate\\nwas. He even stopped swearing. He stood and stared down at me. It took\\nhim ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then\\nhe said impressively: 'Well, if this don't beat hell!' and turned to his\\nwork with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem too\\nabstruse for solution.\\n\\nI crept away, and courted solitude for the rest of the day. I did not go\\nto dinner; I stayed away from supper until everybody else had finished.\\nI did not feel so much like a member of the boat's family now as before.\\nHowever, my spirits returned, in installments, as we pursued our way\\ndown the river. I was sorry I hated the mate so, because it was not in\\n(young) human nature not to admire him. He was huge and muscular, his\\nface was bearded and whiskered all over; he had a red woman and a blue\\nwoman tattooed on his right arm,--one on each side of a blue anchor with\\na red rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was sublime. When he\\nwas getting out cargo at a landing, I was always where I could see and\\nhear. He felt all the majesty of his great position, and made the world\\nfeel it, too. When he gave even the simplest order, he discharged\\nit like a blast of lightning, and sent a long, reverberating peal of\\nprofanity thundering after it. I could not help contrasting the way in\\nwhich the average landsman would give an order, with the mate's way\\nof doing it. If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot\\nfarther forward, he would probably say: 'James, or William, one of you\\npush that plank forward, please;' but put the mate in his place and he\\nwould roar out: 'Here, now, start that gang-plank for'ard! Lively, now!\\n_what_'re you about! Snatch it! SNATCH it! There! there! Aft again! aft\\nagain! don't you hear me. Dash it to dash! are you going to _sleep _over\\nit! '_Vast _heaving. 'Vast heaving, I tell you! Going to heave it clear\\nastern? _Where_'re you going with that barrel! _For'ard_ with it 'fore\\nI make you swallow it, you dash-dash-dash-_dashed _split between a tired\\nmud-turtle and a crippled hearse-horse!'\\n\\nI wished I could talk like that.\\n\\nWhen the soreness of my adventure with the mate had somewhat worn off,\\nI began timidly to make up to the humblest official connected with\\nthe boat--the night watchman. He snubbed my advances at first, but I\\npresently ventured to offer him a new chalk pipe; and that softened him.\\nSo he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the hurricane deck,\\nand in time he melted into conversation. He could not well have helped\\nit, I hung with such homage on his words and so plainly showed that\\nI felt honored by his notice. He told me the names of dim capes and\\nshadowy islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night,\\nunder the winking stars, and by and by got to talking about himself.\\nHe seemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary was six dollars a\\nweek--or rather he might have seemed so to an older person than I. But\\nI drank in his words hungrily, and with a faith that might have moved\\nmountains if it had been applied judiciously. What was it to me that he\\nwas soiled and seedy and fragrant with gin? What was it to me that his\\ngrammar was bad, his construction worse, and his profanity so void\\nof art that it was an element of weakness rather than strength in his\\nconversation? He was a wronged man, a man who had seen trouble, and that\\nwas enough for me. As he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears\\ndripped upon the lantern in his lap, and I cried, too, from sympathy.\\n\\nHe said he was the son of an English nobleman--either an earl or an\\nalderman, he could not remember which, but believed was both; his\\nfather, the nobleman, loved him, but his mother hated him from the\\ncradle; and so while he was still a little boy he was sent to 'one of\\nthem old, ancient colleges'--he couldn't remember which; and by and by\\nhis father died and his mother seized the property and 'shook' him as\\nhe phrased it. After his mother shook him, members of the nobility with\\nwhom he was acquainted used their influence to get him the position of\\n'loblolly-boy in a ship;' and from that point my watchman threw off all\\ntrammels of date and locality and branched out into a narrative that\\nbristled all along with incredible adventures; a narrative that was so\\nreeking with bloodshed and so crammed with hair-breadth escapes and\\nthe most engaging and unconscious personal villainies, that I sat\\nspeechless, enjoying, shuddering, wondering, worshipping.\\n\\nIt was a sore blight to find out afterwards that he was a low, vulgar,\\nignorant, sentimental, half-witted humbug, an untraveled native of the\\nwilds of Illinois, who had absorbed wildcat literature and appropriated\\nits marvels, until in time he had woven odds and ends of the mess into\\nthis yarn, and then gone on telling it to fledglings like me, until he\\nhad come to believe it himself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 6\\n\\nA Cub-pilot's Experience\\n\\nWHAT with lying on the rocks four days at Louisville, and some other\\ndelays, the poor old 'Paul Jones' fooled away about two weeks in making\\nthe voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans. This gave me a chance to get\\nacquainted with one of the pilots, and he taught me how to steer the\\nboat, and thus made the fascination of river life more potent than ever\\nfor me.\\n\\nIt also gave me a chance to get acquainted with a youth who had taken\\ndeck passage--more's the pity; for he easily borrowed six dollars of me\\non a promise to return to the boat and pay it back to me the day after\\nwe should arrive. But he probably died or forgot, for he never came. It\\nwas doubtless the former, since he had said his parents were wealthy,\\nand he only traveled deck passage because it was cooler.{footnote [1.\\n'Deck' Passage, i.e. steerage passage.]}\\n\\nI soon discovered two things. One was that a vessel would not be likely\\nto sail for the mouth of the Amazon under ten or twelve years; and the\\nother was that the nine or ten dollars still left in my pocket would not\\nsuffice for so imposing an exploration as I had planned, even if I could\\nafford to wait for a ship. Therefore it followed that I must contrive\\na new career. The 'Paul Jones' was now bound for St. Louis. I planned\\na siege against my pilot, and at the end of three hard days he\\nsurrendered. He agreed to teach me the Mississippi River from New\\nOrleans to St. Louis for five hundred dollars, payable out of the\\nfirst wages I should receive after graduating. I entered upon the small\\nenterprise of 'learning' twelve or thirteen hundred miles of the great\\nMississippi River with the easy confidence of my time of life. If I had\\nreally known what I was about to require of my faculties, I should not\\nhave had the courage to begin. I supposed that all a pilot had to do was\\nto keep his boat in the river, and I did not consider that that could be\\nmuch of a trick, since it was so wide.\\n\\nThe boat backed out from New Orleans at four in the afternoon, and it\\nwas 'our watch' until eight. Mr. Bixby, my chief, 'straightened her\\nup,' plowed her along past the sterns of the other boats that lay at the\\nLevee, and then said, 'Here, take her; shave those steamships as close\\nas you'd peel an apple.' I took the wheel, and my heart-beat fluttered\\nup into the hundreds; for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape\\nthe side off every ship in the line, we were so close. I held my breath\\nand began to claw the boat away from the danger; and I had my own\\nopinion of the pilot who had known no better than to get us into such\\nperil, but I was too wise to express it. In half a minute I had a wide\\nmargin of safety intervening between the 'Paul Jones' and the ships; and\\nwithin ten seconds more I was set aside in disgrace, and Mr. Bixby was\\ngoing into danger again and flaying me alive with abuse of my cowardice.\\nI was stung, but I was obliged to admire the easy confidence with which\\nmy chief loafed from side to side of his wheel, and trimmed the ships so\\nclosely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent. When he had cooled a\\nlittle he told me that the easy water was close ashore and the current\\noutside, and therefore we must hug the bank, up-stream, to get the\\nbenefit of the former, and stay well out, down-stream, to take advantage\\nof the latter. In my own mind I resolved to be a down-stream pilot and\\nleave the up-streaming to people dead to prudence.\\n\\nNow and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain things. Said\\nhe, 'This is Six-Mile Point.' I assented. It was pleasant enough\\ninformation, but I could not see the bearing of it. I was not conscious\\nthat it was a matter of any interest to me. Another time he said, 'This\\nis Nine-Mile Point.' Later he said, 'This is Twelve-Mile Point.' They\\nwere all about level with the water's edge; they all looked about alike\\nto me; they were monotonously unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. Bixby would\\nchange the subject. But no; he would crowd up around a point, hugging\\nthe shore with affection, and then say: 'The slack water ends here,\\nabreast this bunch of China-trees; now we cross over.' So he crossed\\nover. He gave me the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either\\ncame near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed too\\nfar from shore, and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused.\\n\\nThe watch was ended at last, and we took supper and went to bed. At\\nmidnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes, and the night watchman\\nsaid--\\n\\n'Come! turn out!'\\n\\nAnd then he left. I could not understand this extraordinary procedure;\\nso I presently gave up trying to, and dozed off to sleep. Pretty soon\\nthe watchman was back again, and this time he was gruff. I was annoyed.\\nI said:--\\n\\n'What do you want to come bothering around here in the middle of the\\nnight for. Now as like as not I'll not get to sleep again to-night.'\\n\\nThe watchman said--\\n\\n'Well, if this an't good, I'm blest.'\\n\\nThe 'off-watch' was just turning in, and I heard some brutal laughter\\nfrom them, and such remarks as 'Hello, watchman! an't the new cub turned\\nout yet? He's delicate, likely. Give him some sugar in a rag and send\\nfor the chambermaid to sing rock-a-by-baby to him.'\\n\\nAbout this time Mr. Bixby appeared on the scene. Something like a minute\\nlater I was climbing the pilot-house steps with some of my clothes on\\nand the rest in my arms. Mr. Bixby was close behind, commenting. Here\\nwas something fresh--this thing of getting up in the middle of the night\\nto go to work. It was a detail in piloting that had never occurred to\\nme at all. I knew that boats ran all night, but somehow I had never\\nhappened to reflect that somebody had to get up out of a warm bed to run\\nthem. I began to fear that piloting was not quite so romantic as I had\\nimagined it was; there was something very real and work-like about this\\nnew phase of it.\\n\\nIt was a rather dingy night, although a fair number of stars were out.\\nThe big mate was at the wheel, and he had the old tub pointed at a star\\nand was holding her straight up the middle of the river. The shores on\\neither hand were not much more than half a mile apart, but they seemed\\nwonderfully far away and ever so vague and indistinct. The mate said:--\\n\\n'We've got to land at Jones's plantation, sir.'\\n\\nThe vengeful spirit in me exulted. I said to myself, I wish you joy\\nof your job, Mr. Bixby; you'll have a good time finding Mr. Jones's\\nplantation such a night as this; and I hope you never _will _find it as\\nlong as you live.\\n\\nMr. Bixby said to the mate:--\\n\\n'Upper end of the plantation, or the lower?'\\n\\n'Upper.'\\n\\n'I can't do it. The stumps there are out of water at this stage: It's no\\ngreat distance to the lower, and you'll have to get along with that.'\\n\\n'All right, sir. If Jones don't like it he'll have to lump it, I\\nreckon.'\\n\\nAnd then the mate left. My exultation began to cool and my wonder to\\ncome up. Here was a man who not only proposed to find this plantation on\\nsuch a night, but to find either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully\\nwanted to ask a question, but I was carrying about as many short answers\\nas my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. All I desired\\nto ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass enough to\\nreally imagine he was going to find that plantation on a night when all\\nplantations were exactly alike and all the same color. But I held in. I\\nused to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.\\n\\nMr. Bixby made for the shore and soon was scraping it, just the same as\\nif it had been daylight. And not only that, but singing--\\n\\n'Father in heaven, the day is declining,' etc.\\n\\nIt seemed to me that I had put my life in the keeping of a peculiarly\\nreckless outcast. Presently he turned on me and said:--\\n\\n'What's the name of the first point above New Orleans?'\\n\\nI was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I\\ndidn't know.\\n\\n'Don't _know_?'\\n\\nThis manner jolted me. I was down at the foot again, in a moment. But I\\nhad to say just what I had said before.\\n\\n'Well, you're a smart one,' said Mr. Bixby. 'What's the name of the\\n_next_ point?'\\n\\nOnce more I didn't know.\\n\\n'Well, this beats anything. Tell me the name of _any _point or place I\\ntold you.'\\n\\nI studied a while and decided that I couldn't.\\n\\n'Look here! What do you start out from, above Twelve-Mile Point, to\\ncross over?'\\n\\n'I--I--don't know.'\\n\\n'You--you--don't know?' mimicking my drawling manner of speech. 'What\\n_do_ you know?'\\n\\n'I--I--nothing, for certain.'\\n\\n'By the great Caesar's ghost, I believe you! You're the stupidest\\ndunderhead I ever saw or ever heard of, so help me Moses! The idea of\\nyou being a pilot--you! Why, you don't know enough to pilot a cow down a\\nlane.'\\n\\nOh, but his wrath was up! He was a nervous man, and he shuffled from one\\nside of his wheel to the other as if the floor was hot. He would boil a\\nwhile to himself, and then overflow and scald me again.\\n\\n'Look here! What do you suppose I told you the names of those points\\nfor?'\\n\\nI tremblingly considered a moment, and then the devil of temptation\\nprovoked me to say:--\\n\\n'Well--to--to--be entertaining, I thought.'\\n\\nThis was a red rag to the bull. He raged and stormed so (he was crossing\\nthe river at the time) that I judge it made him blind, because he ran\\nover the steering-oar of a trading-scow. Of course the traders sent up\\na volley of red-hot profanity. Never was a man so grateful as Mr. Bixby\\nwas: because he was brim full, and here were subjects who would\\n_talk back_. He threw open a window, thrust his head out, and such an\\nirruption followed as I never had heard before. The fainter and farther\\naway the scowmen's curses drifted, the higher Mr. Bixby lifted his voice\\nand the weightier his adjectives grew. When he closed the window he was\\nempty. You could have drawn a seine through his system and not caught\\ncurses enough to disturb your mother with. Presently he said to me in\\nthe gentlest way--\\n\\n'My boy, you must get a little memorandum book, and every time I tell\\nyou a thing, put it down right away. There's only one way to be a pilot,\\nand that is to get this entire river by heart. You have to know it just\\nlike A B C.'\\n\\nThat was a dismal revelation to me; for my memory was never loaded with\\nanything but blank cartridges. However, I did not feel discouraged long.\\nI judged that it was best to make some allowances, for doubtless Mr.\\nBixby was 'stretching.' Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few\\nstrokes on the big bell. The stars were all gone now, and the night was\\nas black as ink. I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I\\nwas not entirely certain that I could see the shore. The voice of the\\ninvisible watchman called up from the hurricane deck--\\n\\n'What's this, sir?'\\n\\n'Jones's plantation.'\\n\\nI said to myself, I wish I might venture to offer a small bet that it\\nisn't. But I did not chirp. I only waited to see. Mr. Bixby handled the\\nengine bells, and in due time the boat's nose came to the land, a torch\\nglowed from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darky's voice on the\\nbank said, 'Gimme de k'yarpet-bag, Mars' Jones,' and the next moment we\\nwere standing up the river again, all serene. I reflected deeply awhile,\\nand then said--but not aloud--'Well, the finding of that plantation was\\nthe luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn't happen again\\nin a hundred years.' And I fully believed it was an accident, too.\\n\\nBy the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up the river, I had\\nlearned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream steersman, in daylight,\\nand before we reached St. Louis I had made a trifle of progress in\\nnight-work, but only a trifle. I had a note-book that fairly bristled\\nwith the names of towns, 'points,' bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc.;\\nbut the information was to be found only in the notebook--none of it was\\nin my head. It made my heart ache to think I had only got half of the\\nriver set down; for as our watch was four hours off and four hours on,\\nday and night, there was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time\\nI had slept since the voyage began.\\n\\nMy chief was presently hired to go on a big New Orleans boat, and I\\npacked my satchel and went with him. She was a grand affair. When I\\nstood in her pilot-house I was so far above the water that I seemed\\nperched on a mountain; and her decks stretched so far away, fore and\\naft, below me, that I wondered how I could ever have considered the\\nlittle 'Paul Jones' a large craft. There were other differences, too.\\nThe 'Paul Jones's' pilot-house was a cheap, dingy, battered rattle-trap,\\ncramped for room: but here was a sumptuous glass temple; room enough to\\nhave a dance in; showy red and gold window-curtains; an imposing sofa;\\nleather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots sit,\\nto spin yarns and 'look at the river;' bright, fanciful 'cuspadores'\\ninstead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth\\non the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel as high as my\\nhead, costly with inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright brass knobs\\nfor the bells; and a tidy, white-aproned, black 'texas-tender,' to bring\\nup tarts and ices and coffee during mid-watch, day and night. Now this\\nwas 'something like,' and so I began to take heart once more to believe\\nthat piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after all. The moment we\\nwere under way I began to prowl about the great steamer and fill myself\\nwith joy. She was as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room; when I\\nlooked down her long, gilded saloon, it was like gazing through a\\nsplendid tunnel; she had an oil-picture, by some gifted sign-painter,\\non every stateroom door; she glittered with no end of prism-fringed\\nchandeliers; the clerk's office was elegant, the bar was marvelous, and\\nthe bar-keeper had been barbered and upholstered at incredible cost.\\nThe boiler deck (i.e. the second story of the boat, so to speak) was as\\nspacious as a church, it seemed to me; so with the forecastle; and\\nthere was no pitiful handful of deckhands, firemen, and roustabouts down\\nthere, but a whole battalion of men. The fires were fiercely glaring\\nfrom a long row of furnaces, and over them were eight huge boilers!\\nThis was unutterable pomp. The mighty engines--but enough of this. I had\\nnever felt so fine before. And when I found that the regiment of natty\\nservants respectfully 'sir'd' me, my satisfaction was complete.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 7\\n\\nA Daring Deed\\n\\nWHEN I returned to the pilot-house St. Louis was gone and I was lost.\\nHere was a piece of river which was all down in my book, but I could\\nmake neither head nor tail of it: you understand, it was turned around.\\nI had seen it when coming up-stream, but I had never faced about to see\\nhow it looked when it was behind me. My heart broke again, for it was\\nplain that I had got to learn this troublesome river _both ways_.\\n\\nThe pilot-house was full of pilots, going down to 'look at the river.'\\nWhat is called the 'upper river' (the two hundred miles between St.\\nLouis and Cairo, where the Ohio comes in) was low; and the Mississippi\\nchanges its channel so constantly that the pilots used to always find\\nit necessary to run down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when their boats\\nwere to lie in port a week; that is, when the water was at a low stage.\\nA deal of this 'looking at the river' was done by poor fellows who\\nseldom had a berth, and whose only hope of getting one lay in their\\nbeing always freshly posted and therefore ready to drop into the shoes\\nof some reputable pilot, for a single trip, on account of such pilot's\\nsudden illness, or some other necessity. And a good many of them\\nconstantly ran up and down inspecting the river, not because they ever\\nreally hoped to get a berth, but because (they being guests of the boat)\\nit was cheaper to 'look at the river' than stay ashore and pay board. In\\ntime these fellows grew dainty in their tastes, and only infested boats\\nthat had an established reputation for setting good tables. All visiting\\npilots were useful, for they were always ready and willing, winter or\\nsummer, night or day, to go out in the yawl and help buoy the channel\\nor assist the boat's pilots in any way they could. They were likewise\\nwelcome because all pilots are tireless talkers, when gathered together,\\nand as they talk only about the river they are always understood and\\nare always interesting. Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on\\nearth but the river, and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride\\nof kings.\\n\\nWe had a fine company of these river-inspectors along, this trip. There\\nwere eight or ten; and there was abundance of room for them in our great\\npilot-house. Two or three of them wore polished silk hats, elaborate\\nshirt-fronts, diamond breast-pins, kid gloves, and patent-leather boots.\\nThey were choice in their English, and bore themselves with a dignity\\nproper to men of solid means and prodigious reputation as pilots. The\\nothers were more or less loosely clad, and wore upon their heads tall\\nfelt cones that were suggestive of the days of the Commonwealth.\\n\\nI was a cipher in this august company, and felt subdued, not to say\\ntorpid. I was not even of sufficient consequence to assist at the wheel\\nwhen it was necessary to put the tiller hard down in a hurry; the guest\\nthat stood nearest did that when occasion required--and this was pretty\\nmuch all the time, because of the crookedness of the channel and the\\nscant water. I stood in a corner; and the talk I listened to took the\\nhope all out of me. One visitor said to another--\\n\\n'Jim, how did you run Plum Point, coming up?'\\n\\n'It was in the night, there, and I ran it the way one of the boys on the\\n“Diana” told me; started out about fifty yards above the wood pile on\\nthe false point, and held on the cabin under Plum Point till I raised\\nthe reef--quarter less twain--then straightened up for the middle bar\\ntill I got well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the bend,\\nthen got my stern on the cotton-wood and head on the low place above the\\npoint, and came through a-booming--nine and a half.'\\n\\n'Pretty square crossing, an't it?'\\n\\n'Yes, but the upper bar 's working down fast.'\\n\\nAnother pilot spoke up and said--\\n\\n'I had better water than that, and ran it lower down; started out from\\nthe false point--mark twain--raised the second reef abreast the big snag\\nin the bend, and had quarter less twain.'\\n\\nOne of the gorgeous ones remarked--\\n\\n'I don't want to find fault with your leadsmen, but that's a good deal\\nof water for Plum Point, it seems to me.'\\n\\nThere was an approving nod all around as this quiet snub dropped on\\nthe boaster and 'settled' him. And so they went on talk-talk-talking.\\nMeantime, the thing that was running in my mind was, 'Now if my ears\\nhear aright, I have not only to get the names of all the towns and\\nislands and bends, and so on, by heart, but I must even get up a warm\\npersonal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cotton-wood\\nand obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve\\nhundred miles; and more than that, I must actually know where these\\nthings are in the dark, unless these guests are gifted with eyes that\\ncan pierce through two miles of solid blackness; I wish the piloting\\nbusiness was in Jericho and I had never thought of it.'\\n\\nAt dusk Mr. Bixby tapped the big bell three times (the signal to land),\\nand the captain emerged from his drawing-room in the forward end of the\\ntexas, and looked up inquiringly. Mr. Bixby said--\\n\\n'We will lay up here all night, captain.'\\n\\n'Very well, sir.'\\n\\nThat was all. The boat came to shore and was tied up for the night. It\\nseemed to me a fine thing that the pilot could do as he pleased, without\\nasking so grand a captain's permission. I took my supper and\\nwent immediately to bed, discouraged by my day's observations and\\nexperiences. My late voyage's note-booking was but a confusion of\\nmeaningless names. It had tangled me all up in a knot every time I had\\nlooked at it in the daytime. I now hoped for respite in sleep; but\\nno, it reveled all through my head till sunrise again, a frantic and\\ntireless nightmare.\\n\\nNext morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited. We went booming\\nalong, taking a good many chances, for we were anxious to 'get out of\\nthe river' (as getting out to Cairo was called) before night should\\novertake us. But Mr. Bixby's partner, the other pilot, presently\\ngrounded the boat, and we lost so much time in getting her off that\\nit was plain that darkness would overtake us a good long way above\\nthe mouth. This was a great misfortune, especially to certain of our\\nvisiting pilots, whose boats would have to wait for their return, no\\nmatter how long that might be. It sobered the pilot-house talk a good\\ndeal. Coming up-stream, pilots did not mind low water or any kind\\nof darkness; nothing stopped them but fog. But down-stream work was\\ndifferent; a boat was too nearly helpless, with a stiff current pushing\\nbehind her; so it was not customary to run down-stream at night in low\\nwater.\\n\\nThere seemed to be one small hope, however: if we could get through\\nthe intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing before night, we could\\nventure the rest, for we would have plainer sailing and better water.\\nBut it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night. So there was\\na deal of looking at watches all the rest of the day, and a constant\\nciphering upon the speed we were making; Hat Island was the eternal\\nsubject; sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a\\nbad crossing, and down it went again. For hours all hands lay under the\\nburden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated to me,\\nand I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such\\nan awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have five\\nminutes on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, and start over\\nagain. We were standing no regular watches. Each of our pilots ran such\\nportions of the river as he had run when coming up-stream, because of\\nhis greater familiarity with it; but both remained in the pilot house\\nconstantly.\\n\\nAn hour before sunset, Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr. W----stepped\\naside. For the next thirty minutes every man held his watch in his hand\\nand was restless, silent, and uneasy. At last somebody said, with a\\ndoomful sigh--\\n\\n'Well, yonder's Hat Island--and we can't make it.' All the watches\\nclosed with a snap, everybody sighed and muttered something about its\\nbeing 'too bad, too bad--ah, if we could only have got here half an hour\\nsooner!' and the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment.\\nSome started to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to land. The\\nsun dipped behind the horizon, the boat went on. Inquiring looks passed\\nfrom one guest to another; and one who had his hand on the door-knob\\nand had turned it, waited, then presently took away his hand and let the\\nknob turn back again. We bore steadily down the bend. More looks were\\nexchanged, and nods of surprised admiration--but no words. Insensibly\\nthe men drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one or\\ntwo dim stars came out. The dead silence and sense of waiting became\\noppressive. Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and two deep, mellow notes from\\nthe big bell floated off on the night. Then a pause, and one more note\\nwas struck. The watchman's voice followed, from the hurricane deck--\\n\\n'Labboard lead, there! Stabboard lead!'\\n\\nThe cries of the leadsmen began to rise out of the distance, and were\\ngruffly repeated by the word-passers on the hurricane deck.\\n\\n'M-a-r-k three!... M-a-r-k three!... Quarter-less three!... Half\\ntwain!... Quarter twain!... M-a-r-k twain!... Quarter-less--'\\n\\nMr. Bixby pulled two bell-ropes, and was answered by faint jinglings far\\nbelow in the engine room, and our speed slackened. The steam began to\\nwhistle through the gauge-cocks. The cries of the leadsmen went on--and\\nit is a weird sound, always, in the night. Every pilot in the lot was\\nwatching now, with fixed eyes, and talking under his breath. Nobody was\\ncalm and easy but Mr. Bixby. He would put his wheel down and stand on\\na spoke, and as the steamer swung into her (to me) utterly invisible\\nmarks--for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and gloomy sea--he\\nwould meet and fasten her there. Out of the murmur of half-audible talk,\\none caught a coherent sentence now and then--such as--\\n\\n'There; she's over the first reef all right!'\\n\\nAfter a pause, another subdued voice--\\n\\n'Her stern's coming down just exactly right, by George!'\\n\\n'Now she's in the marks; over she goes!'\\n\\nSomebody else muttered--\\n\\n'Oh, it was done beautiful--_beautiful_!'\\n\\nNow the engines were stopped altogether, and we drifted with the\\ncurrent. Not that I could see the boat drift, for I could not, the stars\\nbeing all gone by this time. This drifting was the dismalest work; it\\nheld one's heart still. Presently I discovered a blacker gloom than\\nthat which surrounded us. It was the head of the island. We were closing\\nright down upon it. We entered its deeper shadow, and so imminent\\nseemed the peril that I was likely to suffocate; and I had the strongest\\nimpulse to do _something_, anything, to save the vessel. But still Mr.\\nBixby stood by his wheel, silent, intent as a cat, and all the pilots\\nstood shoulder to shoulder at his back.\\n\\n'She'll not make it!' somebody whispered.\\n\\nThe water grew shoaler and shoaler, by the leadsman's cries, till it was\\ndown to--\\n\\n'Eight-and-a-half!.... E-i-g-h-t feet!.... E-i-g-h-t feet!....\\nSeven-and--'\\n\\nMr. Bixby said warningly through his speaking tube to the engineer--\\n\\n'Stand by, now!'\\n\\n'Aye-aye, sir!'\\n\\n'Seven-and-a-half! Seven feet! Six-and--'\\n\\nWe touched bottom! Instantly Mr. Bixby set a lot of bells ringing,\\nshouted through the tube, 'NOW, let her have it--every ounce you've\\ngot!' then to his partner, 'Put her hard down! snatch her! snatch her!'\\nThe boat rasped and ground her way through the sand, hung upon the apex\\nof disaster a single tremendous instant, and then over she went! And\\nsuch a shout as went up at Mr. Bixby's back never loosened the roof of a\\npilot-house before!\\n\\nThere was no more trouble after that. Mr. Bixby was a hero that night;\\nand it was some little time, too, before his exploit ceased to be talked\\nabout by river men.\\n\\nFully to realize the marvelous precision required in laying the great\\nsteamer in her marks in that murky waste of water, one should know that\\nnot only must she pick her intricate way through snags and blind\\nreefs, and then shave the head of the island so closely as to brush\\nthe overhanging foliage with her stern, but at one place she must pass\\nalmost within arm's reach of a sunken and invisible wreck that would\\nsnatch the hull timbers from under her if she should strike it, and\\ndestroy a quarter of a million dollars' worth of steam-boat and cargo\\nin five minutes, and maybe a hundred and fifty human lives into the\\nbargain.\\n\\nThe last remark I heard that night was a compliment to Mr. Bixby,\\nuttered in soliloquy and with unction by one of our guests. He said--\\n\\n'By the Shadow of Death, but he's a lightning pilot!'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 8\\n\\nPerplexing Lessons\\n\\nAt the end of what seemed a tedious while, I had managed to pack my\\nhead full of islands, towns, bars, 'points,' and bends; and a curiously\\ninanimate mass of lumber it was, too. However, inasmuch as I could shut\\nmy eyes and reel off a good long string of these names without leaving\\nout more than ten miles of river in every fifty, I began to feel that\\nI could take a boat down to New Orleans if I could make her skip those\\nlittle gaps. But of course my complacency could hardly get start enough\\nto lift my nose a trifle into the air, before Mr. Bixby would think of\\nsomething to fetch it down again. One day he turned on me suddenly with\\nthis settler--\\n\\n'What is the shape of Walnut Bend?'\\n\\nHe might as well have asked me my grandmother's opinion of protoplasm.\\nI reflected respectfully, and then said I didn't know it had any\\nparticular shape. My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang, of course,\\nand then went on loading and firing until he was out of adjectives.\\n\\nI had learned long ago that he only carried just so many rounds of\\nammunition, and was sure to subside into a very placable and even\\nremorseful old smooth-bore as soon as they were all gone. That word\\n'old' is merely affectionate; he was not more than thirty-four. I\\nwaited. By and by he said--\\n\\n'My boy, you've got to know the _shape _of the river perfectly. It is\\nall there is left to steer by on a very dark night. Everything else\\nis blotted out and gone. But mind you, it hasn't the same shape in the\\nnight that it has in the day-time.'\\n\\n'How on earth am I ever going to learn it, then?'\\n\\n'How do you follow a hall at home in the dark. Because you know the\\nshape of it. You can't see it.'\\n\\n'Do you mean to say that I've got to know all the million trifling\\nvariations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well as I\\nknow the shape of the front hall at home?'\\n\\n'On my honor, you've got to know them _better _than any man ever did\\nknow the shapes of the halls in his own house.'\\n\\n'I wish I was dead!'\\n\\n'Now I don't want to discourage you, but--'\\n\\n'Well, pile it on me; I might as well have it now as another time.'\\n\\n'You see, this has got to be learned; there isn't any getting around\\nit. A clear starlight night throws such heavy shadows that if you didn't\\nknow the shape of a shore perfectly you would claw away from every bunch\\nof timber, because you would take the black shadow of it for a solid\\ncape; and you see you would be getting scared to death every fifteen\\nminutes by the watch. You would be fifty yards from shore all the time\\nwhen you ought to be within fifty feet of it. You can't see a snag in\\none of those shadows, but you know exactly where it is, and the shape\\nof the river tells you when you are coming to it. Then there's your\\npitch-dark night; the river is a very different shape on a pitch-dark\\nnight from what it is on a starlight night. All shores seem to be\\nstraight lines, then, and mighty dim ones, too; and you'd _run _them for\\nstraight lines only you know better. You boldly drive your boat right\\ninto what seems to be a solid, straight wall (you knowing very well that\\nin reality there is a curve there), and that wall falls back and makes\\nway for you. Then there's your gray mist. You take a night when there's\\none of these grisly, drizzly, gray mists, and then there isn't any\\nparticular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle the head of the\\noldest man that ever lived. Well, then, different kinds of _moonlight\\n_change the shape of the river in different ways. You see--'\\n\\n'Oh, don't say any more, please! Have I got to learn the shape of the\\nriver according to all these five hundred thousand different ways? If\\nI tried to carry all that cargo in my head it would make me\\nstoop-shouldered.'\\n\\n'_No_! you only learn _the _shape of the river, and you learn it with\\nsuch absolute certainty that you can always steer by the shape that's\\n_in your head_, and never mind the one that's before your eyes.'\\n\\n'Very well, I'll try it; but after I have learned it can I depend on it.\\nWill it keep the same form and not go fooling around?'\\n\\nBefore Mr. Bixby could answer, Mr. W---- came in to take the watch, and\\nhe said--\\n\\n'Bixby, you'll have to look out for President's Island and all that\\ncountry clear away up above the Old Hen and Chickens. The banks are\\ncaving and the shape of the shores changing like everything. Why,\\nyou wouldn't know the point above 40. You can go up inside the old\\nsycamore-snag, now.{footnote [1. It may not be necessary, but still it\\ncan do no harm to explain that 'inside' means between the snag and the\\nshore.--M.T.]}\\n\\nSo that question was answered. Here were leagues of shore changing\\nshape. My spirits were down in the mud again. Two things seemed pretty\\napparent to me. One was, that in order to be a pilot a man had got to\\nlearn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other\\nwas, that he must learn it all over again in a different way every\\ntwenty-four hours.\\n\\nThat night we had the watch until twelve. Now it was an ancient river\\ncustom for the two pilots to chat a bit when the watch changed. While\\nthe relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit his cigar, his partner,\\nthe retiring pilot, would say something like this--\\n\\n'I judge the upper bar is making down a little at Hale's Point; had\\nquarter twain with the lower lead and mark twain {footnote [Two fathoms.\\n'Quarter twain' is two-and-a-quarter fathoms, thirteen-and-a-half feet.\\n'Mark three' is three fathoms.]} with the other.'\\n\\n'Yes, I thought it was making down a little, last trip. Meet any boats?'\\n\\n'Met one abreast the head of 21, but she was away over hugging the\\nbar, and I couldn't make her out entirely. I took her for the “Sunny\\nSouth”--hadn't any skylights forward of the chimneys.'\\n\\nAnd so on. And as the relieving pilot took the wheel his partner\\n{footnote ['Partner' is a technical term for 'the other pilot'.]} would\\nmention that we were in such-and-such a bend, and say we were abreast\\nof such-and-such a man's wood-yard or plantation. This was courtesy;\\nI supposed it was necessity. But Mr. W---- came on watch full twelve\\nminutes late on this particular night,--a tremendous breach of\\netiquette; in fact, it is the unpardonable sin among pilots. So Mr.\\nBixby gave him no greeting whatever, but simply surrendered the wheel\\nand marched out of the pilot-house without a word. I was appalled; it\\nwas a villainous night for blackness, we were in a particularly wide\\nand blind part of the river, where there was no shape or substance to\\nanything, and it seemed incredible that Mr. Bixby should have left that\\npoor fellow to kill the boat trying to find out where he was. But I\\nresolved that I would stand by him any way. He should find that he was\\nnot wholly friendless. So I stood around, and waited to be asked where\\nwe were. But Mr. W---- plunged on serenely through the solid firmament\\nof black cats that stood for an atmosphere, and never opened his mouth.\\nHere is a proud devil, thought I; here is a limb of Satan that would\\nrather send us all to destruction than put himself under obligations to\\nme, because I am not yet one of the salt of the earth and privileged to\\nsnub captains and lord it over everything dead and alive in a steamboat.\\nI presently climbed up on the bench; I did not think it was safe to go\\nto sleep while this lunatic was on watch.\\n\\nHowever, I must have gone to sleep in the course of time, because the\\nnext thing I was aware of was the fact that day was breaking, Mr. W----\\ngone, and Mr. Bixby at the wheel again. So it was four o'clock and all\\nwell--but me; I felt like a skinful of dry bones and all of them trying\\nto ache at once.\\n\\nMr. Bixby asked me what I had stayed up there for. I confessed that it\\nwas to do Mr. W---- a benevolence,--tell him where he was. It took five\\nminutes for the entire preposterousness of the thing to filter into Mr.\\nBixby's system, and then I judge it filled him nearly up to the chin;\\nbecause he paid me a compliment--and not much of a one either. He said,\\n\\n'Well, taking you by-and-large, you do seem to be more different kinds\\nof an ass than any creature I ever saw before. What did you suppose he\\nwanted to know for?'\\n\\nI said I thought it might be a convenience to him.\\n\\n'Convenience D-nation! Didn't I tell you that a man's got to know the\\nriver in the night the same as he'd know his own front hall?'\\n\\n'Well, I can follow the front hall in the dark if I know it _is_ the\\nfront hall; but suppose you set me down in the middle of it in the dark\\nand not tell me which hall it is; how am I to know?'\\n\\n'Well you've _got _to, on the river!'\\n\\n'All right. Then I'm glad I never said anything to Mr. W---- '\\n\\n'I should say so. Why, he'd have slammed you through the window and\\nutterly ruined a hundred dollars' worth of window-sash and stuff.'\\n\\nI was glad this damage had been saved, for it would have made me\\nunpopular with the owners. They always hated anybody who had the name of\\nbeing careless, and injuring things.\\n\\nI went to work now to learn the shape of the river; and of all the\\neluding and ungraspable objects that ever I tried to get mind or hands\\non, that was the chief. I would fasten my eyes upon a sharp, wooded\\npoint that projected far into the river some miles ahead of me, and go\\nto laboriously photographing its shape upon my brain; and just as I was\\nbeginning to succeed to my satisfaction, we would draw up toward it and\\nthe exasperating thing would begin to melt away and fold back into the\\nbank! If there had been a conspicuous dead tree standing upon the very\\npoint of the cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into\\nthe general forest, and occupying the middle of a straight shore, when\\nI got abreast of it! No prominent hill would stick to its shape long\\nenough for me to make up my mind what its form really was, but it was as\\ndissolving and changeful as if it had been a mountain of butter in the\\nhottest corner of the tropics. Nothing ever had the same shape when\\nI was coming downstream that it had borne when I went up. I mentioned\\nthese little difficulties to Mr. Bixby. He said--\\n\\n'That's the very main virtue of the thing. If the shapes didn't change\\nevery three seconds they wouldn't be of any use. Take this place where\\nwe are now, for instance. As long as that hill over yonder is only one\\nhill, I can boom right along the way I'm going; but the moment it splits\\nat the top and forms a V, I know I've got to scratch to starboard in a\\nhurry, or I'll bang this boat's brains out against a rock; and then the\\nmoment one of the prongs of the V swings behind the other, I've got to\\nwaltz to larboard again, or I'll have a misunderstanding with a snag\\nthat would snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it\\nwere a sliver in your hand. If that hill didn't change its shape on bad\\nnights there would be an awful steamboat grave-yard around here inside\\nof a year.'\\n\\nIt was plain that I had got to learn the shape of the river in all the\\ndifferent ways that could be thought of,--upside down, wrong end first,\\ninside out, fore-and-aft, and 'thortships,'--and then know what to do on\\ngray nights when it hadn't any shape at all. So I set about it. In the\\ncourse of time I began to get the best of this knotty lesson, and my\\nself-complacency moved to the front once more. Mr. Bixby was all fixed,\\nand ready to start it to the rear again. He opened on me after this\\nfashion--\\n\\n'How much water did we have in the middle crossing at Hole-in-the-Wall,\\ntrip before last?'\\n\\nI considered this an outrage. I said--\\n\\n'Every trip, down and up, the leadsmen are singing through that tangled\\nplace for three-quarters of an hour on a stretch. How do you reckon I\\ncan remember such a mess as that?'\\n\\n'My boy, you've got to remember it. You've got to remember the exact\\nspot and the exact marks the boat lay in when we had the shoalest water,\\nin everyone of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New\\nOrleans; and you mustn't get the shoal soundings and marks of one trip\\nmixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, either, for\\nthey're not often twice alike. You must keep them separate.'\\n\\nWhen I came to myself again, I said--\\n\\n'When I get so that I can do that, I'll be able to raise the dead,\\nand then I won't have to pilot a steamboat to make a living. I want to\\nretire from this business. I want a slush-bucket and a brush; I'm only\\nfit for a roustabout. I haven't got brains enough to be a pilot; and\\nif I had I wouldn't have strength enough to carry them around, unless I\\nwent on crutches.'\\n\\n'Now drop that! When I say I'll learn {footnote ['Teach' is not in the\\nriver vocabulary.]} a man the river, I mean it. And you can depend on\\nit, I'll learn him or kill him.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 9\\n\\nContinued Perplexities\\n\\nTHERE was no use in arguing with a person like this. I promptly put\\nsuch a strain on my memory that by and by even the shoal water and the\\ncountless crossing-marks began to stay with me. But the result was just\\nthe same. I never could more than get one knotty thing learned before\\nanother presented itself. Now I had often seen pilots gazing at the\\nwater and pretending to read it as if it were a book; but it was a\\nbook that told me nothing. A time came at last, however, when Mr.\\nBixby seemed to think me far enough advanced to bear a lesson on\\nwater-reading. So he began--\\n\\n'Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the water? Now,\\nthat's a reef. Moreover, it's a bluff reef. There is a solid sand-bar\\nunder it that is nearly as straight up and down as the side of a house.\\nThere is plenty of water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it.\\nIf you were to hit it you would knock the boat's brains out. Do you see\\nwhere the line fringes out at the upper end and begins to fade away?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'Well, that is a low place; that is the head of the reef. You can climb\\nover there, and not hurt anything. Cross over, now, and follow along\\nclose under the reef--easy water there--not much current.'\\n\\nI followed the reef along till I approached the fringed end. Then Mr.\\nBixby said--\\n\\n'Now get ready. Wait till I give the word. She won't want to mount the\\nreef; a boat hates shoal water. Stand by--wait--WAIT--keep her well in\\nhand. NOW cramp her down! Snatch her! snatch her!'\\n\\nHe seized the other side of the wheel and helped to spin it around until\\nit was hard down, and then we held it so. The boat resisted, and refused\\nto answer for a while, and next she came surging to starboard, mounted\\nthe reef, and sent a long, angry ridge of water foaming away from her\\nbows.\\n\\n'Now watch her; watch her like a cat, or she'll get away from you. When\\nshe fights strong and the tiller slips a little, in a jerky, greasy sort\\nof way, let up on her a trifle; it is the way she tells you at night\\nthat the water is too shoal; but keep edging her up, little by little,\\ntoward the point. You are well up on the bar, now; there is a bar under\\nevery point, because the water that comes down around it forms an eddy\\nand allows the sediment to sink. Do you see those fine lines on the face\\nof the water that branch out like the ribs of a fan. Well, those are\\nlittle reefs; you want to just miss the ends of them, but run them\\npretty close. Now look out--look out! Don't you crowd that slick,\\ngreasy-looking place; there ain't nine feet there; she won't stand it.\\nShe begins to smell it; look sharp, I tell you! Oh blazes, there you go!\\nStop the starboard wheel! Quick! Ship up to back! Set her back!\\n\\nThe engine bells jingled and the engines answered promptly, shooting\\nwhite columns of steam far aloft out of the 'scape pipes, but it was\\ntoo late. The boat had 'smelt' the bar in good earnest; the foamy ridges\\nthat radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared, a great dead swell\\ncame rolling forward and swept ahead of her, she careened far over to\\nlarboard, and went tearing away toward the other shore as if she were\\nabout scared to death. We were a good mile from where we ought to have\\nbeen, when we finally got the upper hand of her again.\\n\\nDuring the afternoon watch the next day, Mr. Bixby asked me if I knew\\nhow to run the next few miles. I said--\\n\\n'Go inside the first snag above the point, outside the next one, start\\nout from the lower end of Higgins's wood-yard, make a square crossing\\nand--'\\n\\n'That's all right. I'll be back before you close up on the next point.'\\n\\nBut he wasn't. He was still below when I rounded it and entered upon a\\npiece of river which I had some misgivings about. I did not know that\\nhe was hiding behind a chimney to see how I would perform. I went gaily\\nalong, getting prouder and prouder, for he had never left the boat in\\nmy sole charge such a length of time before. I even got to 'setting'\\nher and letting the wheel go, entirely, while I vaingloriously turned\\nmy back and inspected the stem marks and hummed a tune, a sort of easy\\nindifference which I had prodigiously admired in Bixby and other great\\npilots. Once I inspected rather long, and when I faced to the front\\nagain my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if I hadn't clapped\\nmy teeth together I should have lost it. One of those frightful bluff\\nreefs was stretching its deadly length right across our bows! My head\\nwas gone in a moment; I did not know which end I stood on; I gasped and\\ncould not get my breath; I spun the wheel down with such rapidity that\\nit wove itself together like a spider's web; the boat answered and\\nturned square away from the reef, but the reef followed her! I fled, and\\nstill it followed, still it kept--right across my bows! I never looked\\nto see where I was going, I only fled. The awful crash was imminent--why\\ndidn't that villain come! If I committed the crime of ringing a bell,\\nI might get thrown overboard. But better that than kill the boat. So\\nin blind desperation I started such a rattling 'shivaree' down below as\\nnever had astounded an engineer in this world before, I fancy. Amidst\\nthe frenzy of the bells the engines began to back and fill in a furious\\nway, and my reason forsook its throne--we were about to crash into the\\nwoods on the other side of the river. Just then Mr. Bixby stepped calmly\\ninto view on the hurricane deck. My soul went out to him in gratitude.\\nMy distress vanished; I would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara,\\nwith Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck. He blandly and sweetly took\\nhis tooth-pick out of his mouth between his fingers, as if it were a\\ncigar--we were just in the act of climbing an overhanging big tree,\\nand the passengers were scudding astern like rats--and lifted up these\\ncommands to me ever so gently--\\n\\n'Stop the starboard. Stop the larboard. Set her back on both.'\\n\\nThe boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among the boughs a critical\\ninstant, then reluctantly began to back away.\\n\\n'Stop the larboard. Come ahead on it. Stop the starboard. Come ahead on\\nit. Point her for the bar.'\\n\\nI sailed away as serenely as a summer's morning. Mr. Bixby came in and\\nsaid, with mock simplicity--\\n\\n'When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times\\nbefore you land, so that the engineers can get ready.'\\n\\nI blushed under the sarcasm, and said I hadn't had any hail.\\n\\n'Ah! Then it was for wood, I suppose. The officer of the watch will tell\\nyou when he wants to wood up.'\\n\\nI went on consuming and said I wasn't after wood.\\n\\n'Indeed? Why, what could you want over here in the bend, then? Did you\\never know of a boat following a bend up-stream at this stage of the\\nriver?'\\n\\n'No sir,--and I wasn't trying to follow it. I was getting away from a\\nbluff reef.'\\n\\n'No, it wasn't a bluff reef; there isn't one within three miles of where\\nyou were.'\\n\\n'But I saw it. It was as bluff as that one yonder.'\\n\\n'Just about. Run over it!'\\n\\n'Do you give it as an order?'\\n\\n'Yes. Run over it.'\\n\\n'If I don't, I wish I may die.'\\n\\n'All right; I am taking the responsibility.' I was just as anxious to\\nkill the boat, now, as I had been to save her before. I impressed my\\norders upon my memory, to be used at the inquest, and made a straight\\nbreak for the reef. As it disappeared under our bows I held my breath;\\nbut we slid over it like oil.\\n\\n'Now don't you see the difference? It wasn't anything but a _wind _reef.\\nThe wind does that.'\\n\\n'So I see. But it is exactly like a bluff reef. How am I ever going to\\ntell them apart?'\\n\\n'I can't tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you will just naturally\\n_know _one from the other, but you never will be able to explain why or\\nhow you know them apart'\\n\\nIt turned out to be true. The face of the water, in time, became a\\nwonderful book--a book that was a dead language to the uneducated\\npassenger, but which told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its\\nmost cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with a voice.\\nAnd it was not a book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new\\nstory to tell every day. Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there\\nwas never a page that was void of interest, never one that you could\\nleave unread without loss, never one that you would want to skip,\\nthinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing. There\\nnever was so wonderful a book written by man; never one whose interest\\nwas so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparkingly renewed with every\\nreperusal. The passenger who could not read it was charmed with a\\npeculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions\\nwhen he did not overlook it altogether); but to the pilot that was an\\n_italicized _passage; indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of\\nthe largest capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation points at\\nthe end of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that\\ncould tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated. It is\\nthe faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes, and the most\\nhideous to a pilot's eye. In truth, the passenger who could not read\\nthis book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by\\nthe sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas to the trained eye these\\nwere not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of\\nreading-matter.\\n\\nNow when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know\\nevery trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I\\nknew the letters of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition.\\nBut I had lost something, too. I had lost something which could never be\\nrestored to me while I lived. All the grace, the beauty, the poetry had\\ngone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a certain wonderful\\nsunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad\\nexpanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red\\nhue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating,\\nblack and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling\\nupon the water; in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling\\nrings, that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was\\nfaintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and\\nradiating lines, ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was\\ndensely wooded, and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was\\nbroken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver;\\nand high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single\\nleafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that\\nwas flowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images,\\nwoody heights, soft distances; and over the whole scene, far and near,\\nthe dissolving lights drifted steadily, enriching it, every passing\\nmoment, with new marvels of coloring.\\n\\nI stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless rapture. The\\nworld was new to me, and I had never seen anything like this at home.\\nBut as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the\\nglories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight\\nwrought upon the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether\\nto note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should\\nhave looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it,\\ninwardly, after this fashion: This sun means that we are going to have\\nwind to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small\\nthanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef\\nwhich is going to kill somebody's steamboat one of these nights, if\\nit keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling 'boils' show a\\ndissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in\\nthe slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is\\nshoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest\\nis the 'break' from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very\\nbest place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead\\ntree, with a single living branch, is not going to last long, and\\nthen how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night\\nwithout the friendly old landmark.\\n\\nNo, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river. All the\\nvalue any feature of it had for me now was the amount of usefulness it\\ncould furnish toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat. Since\\nthose days, I have pitied doctors from my heart. What does the lovely\\nflush in a beauty's cheek mean to a doctor but a 'break' that ripples\\nabove some deadly disease. Are not all her visible charms sown thick\\nwith what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever\\nsee her beauty at all, or doesn't he simply view her professionally, and\\ncomment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And doesn't he\\nsometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his\\ntrade?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 10\\n\\nCompleting My Education\\n\\nWHOSOEVER has done me the courtesy to read my chapters which have\\npreceded this may possibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting\\nas a science. It was the prime purpose of those chapters; and I am not\\nquite done yet. I wish to show, in the most patient and painstaking way,\\nwhat a wonderful science it is. Ship channels are buoyed and lighted,\\nand therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to learn to run\\nthem; clear-water rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels\\nvery gradually, and therefore one needs to learn them but once; but\\npiloting becomes another matter when you apply it to vast streams like\\nthe Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial banks cave and change\\nconstantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose\\nsandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and\\nshirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and\\nall weathers without the aid of a single light-house or a single buoy;\\nfor there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this\\nthree or four thousand miles of villainous river.{footnote [True at the\\ntime referred to; not true now (1882).]} I feel justified in enlarging\\nupon this great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has ever\\nyet written a paragraph about it who had piloted a steamboat himself,\\nand so had a practical knowledge of the subject. If the theme were\\nhackneyed, I should be obliged to deal gently with the reader; but\\nsince it is wholly new, I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable\\ndegree of room with it.\\n\\nWhen I had learned the name and position of every visible feature of the\\nriver; when I had so mastered its shape that I could shut my eyes and\\ntrace it from St. Louis to New Orleans; when I had learned to read the\\nface of the water as one would cull the news from the morning paper;\\nand finally, when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up an endless\\narray of soundings and crossing-marks, and keep fast hold of them, I\\njudged that my education was complete: so I got to tilting my cap to the\\nside of my head, and wearing a tooth-pick in my mouth at the wheel. Mr.\\nBixby had his eye on these airs. One day he said--\\n\\n'What is the height of that bank yonder, at Burgess's?'\\n\\n'How can I tell, sir. It is three-quarters of a mile away.'\\n\\n'Very poor eye--very poor. Take the glass.'\\n\\nI took the glass, and presently said--'I can't tell. I suppose that that\\nbank is about a foot and a half high.'\\n\\n'Foot and a half! That's a six-foot bank. How high was the bank along\\nhere last trip?'\\n\\n'I don't know; I never noticed.'\\n\\n'You didn't? Well, you must always do it hereafter.'\\n\\n'Why?'\\n\\n'Because you'll have to know a good many things that it tells you.\\nFor one thing, it tells you the stage of the river--tells you whether\\nthere's more water or less in the river along here than there was last\\ntrip.'\\n\\n'The leads tell me that.' I rather thought I had the advantage of him\\nthere.\\n\\n'Yes, but suppose the leads lie? The bank would tell you so, and then\\nyou'd stir those leadsmen up a bit. There was a ten-foot bank here last\\ntrip, and there is only a six-foot bank now. What does that signify?'\\n\\n'That the river is four feet higher than it was last trip.'\\n\\n'Very good. Is the river rising or falling?'\\n\\n'Rising.'\\n\\n'No it ain't.'\\n\\n'I guess I am right, sir. Yonder is some drift-wood floating down the\\nstream.'\\n\\n'A rise starts the drift-wood, but then it keeps on floating a while\\nafter the river is done rising. Now the bank will tell you about this.\\nWait till you come to a place where it shelves a little. Now here; do\\nyou see this narrow belt of fine sediment That was deposited while the\\nwater was higher. You see the driftwood begins to strand, too. The bank\\nhelps in other ways. Do you see that stump on the false point?'\\n\\n'Ay, ay, sir.'\\n\\n'Well, the water is just up to the roots of it. You must make a note of\\nthat.'\\n\\n'Why?'\\n\\n'Because that means that there's seven feet in the chute of 103.'\\n\\n'But 103 is a long way up the river yet.'\\n\\n'That's where the benefit of the bank comes in. There is water enough in\\n103 _now_, yet there may not be by the time we get there; but the bank\\nwill keep us posted all along. You don't run close chutes on a falling\\nriver, up-stream, and there are precious few of them that you are\\nallowed to run at all down-stream. There's a law of the United States\\nagainst it. The river may be rising by the time we get to 103, and in\\nthat case we'll run it. We are drawing--how much?'\\n\\n'Six feet aft,--six and a half forward.'\\n\\n'Well, you do seem to know something.'\\n\\n'But what I particularly want to know is, if I have got to keep up an\\neverlasting measuring of the banks of this river, twelve hundred miles,\\nmonth in and month out?'\\n\\n'Of course!'\\n\\nMy emotions were too deep for words for a while. Presently I said--'\\n\\nAnd how about these chutes. Are there many of them?'\\n\\n'I should say so. I fancy we shan't run any of the river this trip as\\nyou've ever seen it run before--so to speak. If the river begins to rise\\nagain, we'll go up behind bars that you've always seen standing out of\\nthe river, high and dry like the roof of a house; we'll cut across low\\nplaces that you've never noticed at all, right through the middle of\\nbars that cover three hundred acres of river; we'll creep through cracks\\nwhere you've always thought was solid land; we'll dart through the woods\\nand leave twenty-five miles of river off to one side; we'll see the\\nhind-side of every island between New Orleans and Cairo.'\\n\\n'Then I've got to go to work and learn just as much more river as I\\nalready know.'\\n\\n'Just about twice as much more, as near as you can come at it.'\\n\\n'Well, one lives to find out. I think I was a fool when I went into this\\nbusiness.'\\n\\n'Yes, that is true. And you are yet. But you'll not be when you've\\nlearned it.'\\n\\n'Ah, I never can learn it.'\\n\\n'I will see that you _do_.'\\n\\nBy and by I ventured again--\\n\\n'Have I got to learn all this thing just as I know the rest of the\\nriver--shapes and all--and so I can run it at night?'\\n\\n'Yes. And you've got to have good fair marks from one end of the river\\nto the other, that will help the bank tell you when there is water\\nenough in each of these countless places--like that stump, you know.\\nWhen the river first begins to rise, you can run half a dozen of the\\ndeepest of them; when it rises a foot more you can run another dozen;\\nthe next foot will add a couple of dozen, and so on: so you see you have\\nto know your banks and marks to a dead moral certainty, and never get\\nthem mixed; for when you start through one of those cracks, there's\\nno backing out again, as there is in the big river; you've got to go\\nthrough, or stay there six months if you get caught on a falling river.\\nThere are about fifty of these cracks which you can't run at all except\\nwhen the river is brim full and over the banks.'\\n\\n'This new lesson is a cheerful prospect.'\\n\\n'Cheerful enough. And mind what I've just told you; when you start into\\none of those places you've got to go through. They are too narrow to\\nturn around in, too crooked to back out of, and the shoal water is\\nalways up at the head; never elsewhere. And the head of them is always\\nlikely to be filling up, little by little, so that the marks you reckon\\ntheir depth by, this season, may not answer for next.'\\n\\n'Learn a new set, then, every year?'\\n\\n'Exactly. Cramp her up to the bar! What are you standing up through the\\nmiddle of the river for?'\\n\\nThe next few months showed me strange things. On the same day that we\\nheld the conversation above narrated, we met a great rise coming down\\nthe river. The whole vast face of the stream was black with drifting\\ndead logs, broken boughs, and great trees that had caved in and been\\nwashed away. It required the nicest steering to pick one's way through\\nthis rushing raft, even in the day-time, when crossing from point to\\npoint; and at night the difficulty was mightily increased; every now and\\nthen a huge log, lying deep in the water, would suddenly appear right\\nunder our bows, coming head-on; no use to try to avoid it then; we could\\nonly stop the engines, and one wheel would walk over that log from one\\nend to the other, keeping up a thundering racket and careening the boat\\nin a way that was very uncomfortable to passengers. Now and then we\\nwould hit one of these sunken logs a rattling bang, dead in the center,\\nwith a full head of steam, and it would stun the boat as if she had hit\\na continent. Sometimes this log would lodge, and stay right across\\nour nose, and back the Mississippi up before it; we would have to do a\\nlittle craw-fishing, then, to get away from the obstruction. We often\\nhit _white _logs, in the dark, for we could not see them till we were\\nright on them; but a black log is a pretty distinct object at night. A\\nwhite snag is an ugly customer when the daylight is gone.\\n\\nOf course, on the great rise, down came a swarm of prodigious\\ntimber-rafts from the head waters of the Mississippi, coal barges from\\nPittsburgh, little trading scows from everywhere, and broad-horns from\\n'Posey County,' Indiana, freighted with 'fruit and furniture'--the\\nusual term for describing it, though in plain English the freight thus\\naggrandized was hoop-poles and pumpkins. Pilots bore a mortal hatred to\\nthese craft; and it was returned with usury. The law required all such\\nhelpless traders to keep a light burning, but it was a law that was\\noften broken. All of a sudden, on a murky night, a light would hop up,\\nright under our bows, almost, and an agonized voice, with the backwoods\\n'whang' to it, would wail out--\\n\\n'Whar'n the ---- you goin' to! Cain't you see nothin', you dash-dashed\\naig-suckin', sheep-stealin', one-eyed son of a stuffed monkey!'\\n\\nThen for an instant, as we whistled by, the red glare from our furnaces\\nwould reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating orator as if\\nunder a lightning-flash, and in that instant our firemen and deck-hands\\nwould send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity, one of our\\nwheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a steering-oar, and\\ndown the dead blackness would shut again. And that flatboatman would be\\nsure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat, swearing stoutly that he\\nhad a light burning all the time, when in truth his gang had the lantern\\ndown below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by, and no watch on\\ndeck.\\n\\nOnce, at night, in one of those forest-bordered crevices (behind an\\nisland) which steamboatmen intensely describe with the phrase 'as dark\\nas the inside of a cow,' we should have eaten up a Posey County family,\\nfruit, furniture, and all, but that they happened to be fiddling down\\nbelow, and we just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer off,\\ndoing no serious damage, unfortunately, but coming so near it that we\\nhad good hopes for a moment. These people brought up their lantern,\\nthen, of course; and as we backed and filled to get away, the precious\\nfamily stood in the light of it--both sexes and various ages--and cursed\\nus till everything turned blue. Once a coalboatman sent a bullet through\\nour pilot-house, when we borrowed a steering oar of him in a very narrow\\nplace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 11\\n\\nThe River Rises\\n\\nDURING this big rise these small-fry craft were an intolerable nuisance.\\nWe were running chute after chute,--a new world to me,--and if there was\\na particularly cramped place in a chute, we would be pretty sure to meet\\na broad-horn there; and if he failed to be there, we would find him in a\\nstill worse locality, namely, the head of the chute, on the shoal water.\\nAnd then there would be no end of profane cordialities exchanged.\\n\\nSometimes, in the big river, when we would be feeling our way cautiously\\nalong through a fog, the deep hush would suddenly be broken by yells and\\na clamor of tin pans, and all in instant a log raft would appear vaguely\\nthrough the webby veil, close upon us; and then we did not wait to swap\\nknives, but snatched our engine bells out by the roots and piled on all\\nthe steam we had, to scramble out of the way! One doesn't hit a rock or\\na solid log craft with a steamboat when he can get excused.\\n\\nYou will hardly believe it, but many steamboat clerks always carried\\na large assortment of religious tracts with them in those old departed\\nsteamboating days. Indeed they did. Twenty times a day we would be\\ncramping up around a bar, while a string of these small-fry rascals\\nwere drifting down into the head of the bend away above and beyond us a\\ncouple of miles. Now a skiff would dart away from one of them, and come\\nfighting its laborious way across the desert of water. It would 'ease\\nall,' in the shadow of our forecastle, and the panting oarsmen would\\nshout, 'Gimme a pa-a-per!' as the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The\\nclerk would throw over a file of New Orleans journals. If these were\\npicked up without comment, you might notice that now a dozen other\\nskiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying anything. You\\nunderstand, they had been waiting to see how No. 1 was going to fare.\\nNo. 1 making no comment, all the rest would bend to their oars and\\ncome on, now; and as fast as they came the clerk would heave over\\nneat bundles of religious tracts, tied to shingles. The amount of hard\\nswearing which twelve packages of religious literature will command when\\nimpartially divided up among twelve raftsmen's crews, who have pulled a\\nheavy skiff two miles on a hot day to get them, is simply incredible.\\n\\nAs I have said, the big rise brought a new world under my vision. By the\\ntime the river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths and were\\nhourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out of water before;\\nwe were shaving stumpy shores, like that at the foot of Madrid Bend,\\nwhich I had always seen avoided before; we were clattering through\\nchutes like that of 82, where the opening at the foot was an unbroken\\nwall of timber till our nose was almost at the very spot. Some of these\\nchutes were utter solitudes. The dense, untouched forest overhung both\\nbanks of the crooked little crack, and one could believe that human\\ncreatures had never intruded there before. The swinging grape-vines, the\\ngrassy nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by, the flowering creepers\\nwaving their red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks, and all the\\nspendthrift richness of the forest foliage, were wasted and thrown away\\nthere. The chutes were lovely places to steer in; they were deep, except\\nat the head; the current was gentle; under the 'points' the water was\\nabsolutely dead, and the invisible banks so bluff that where the tender\\nwillow thickets projected you could bury your boat's broadside in them\\nas you tore along, and then you seemed fairly to fly.\\n\\nBehind other islands we found wretched little farms, and wretcheder\\nlittle log-cabins; there were crazy rail fences sticking a foot or two\\nabove the water, with one or two jeans-clad, chills-racked, yellow-faced\\nmale miserables roosting on the top-rail, elbows on knees, jaws in\\nhands, grinding tobacco and discharging the result at floating chips\\nthrough crevices left by lost teeth; while the rest of the family and\\nthe few farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding\\nat her moorings close at hand. In this flat-boat the family would have\\nto cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of days (or\\npossibly weeks), until the river should fall two or three feet and let\\nthem get back to their log-cabin and their chills again--chills being\\na merciful provision of an all-wise Providence to enable them to take\\nexercise without exertion. And this sort of watery camping out was a\\nthing which these people were rather liable to be treated to a couple\\nof times a year: by the December rise out of the Ohio, and the June rise\\nout of the Mississippi. And yet these were kindly dispensations, for\\nthey at least enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and\\nthen, and look upon life when a steamboat went by. They appreciated the\\nblessing, too, for they spread their mouths and eyes wide open and made\\nthe most of these occasions. Now what _could _these banished creatures\\nfind to do to keep from dying of the blues during the low-water season!\\n\\nOnce, in one of these lovely island chutes, we found our course\\ncompletely bridged by a great fallen tree. This will serve to show how\\nnarrow some of the chutes were. The passengers had an hour's recreation\\nin a virgin wilderness, while the boat-hands chopped the bridge away;\\nfor there was no such thing as turning back, you comprehend.\\n\\nFrom Cairo to Baton Rouge, when the river is over its banks, you have\\nno particular trouble in the night, for the thousand-mile wall of dense\\nforest that guards the two banks all the way is only gapped with a farm\\nor wood-yard opening at intervals, and so you can't 'get out of the\\nriver' much easier than you could get out of a fenced lane; but from\\nBaton Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter. The river is more\\nthan a mile wide, and very deep--as much as two hundred feet, in places.\\nBoth banks, for a good deal over a hundred miles, are shorn of their\\ntimber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations, with only here and\\nthere a scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees. The timber\\nis shorn off clear to the rear of the plantations, from two to four\\nmiles. When the first frost threatens to come, the planters snatch off\\ntheir crops in a hurry. When they have finished grinding the cane, they\\nform the refuse of the stalks (which they call _bagasse_) into great\\npiles and set fire to them, though in other sugar countries the bagasse\\nis used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills. Now the piles of\\ndamp bagasse burn slowly, and smoke like Satan's own kitchen.\\n\\nAn embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks of the\\nMississippi all the way down that lower end of the river, and this\\nembankment is set back from the edge of the shore from ten to perhaps a\\nhundred feet, according to circumstances; say thirty or forty feet, as\\na general thing. Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of\\nsmoke from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles, when the river is\\nover the banks, and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and\\nsee how she will feel. And see how you will feel, too! You find yourself\\naway out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless, that fades\\nout and loses itself in the murky distances; for you cannot discern\\nthe thin rib of embankment, and you are always imagining you see\\na straggling tree when you don't. The plantations themselves are\\ntransformed by the smoke, and look like a part of the sea. All through\\nyour watch you are tortured with the exquisite misery of uncertainty.\\nYou hope you are keeping in the river, but you do not know. All that you\\nare sure about is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank\\nand destruction, when you think you are a good half-mile from shore. And\\nyou are sure, also, that if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the\\nembankment and topple your chimneys overboard, you will have the small\\ncomfort of knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do. One\\nof the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation one\\nnight, at such a time, and had to stay there a week. But there was no\\nnovelty about it; it had often been done before.\\n\\nI thought I had finished this chapter, but I wish to add a curious\\nthing, while it is in my mind. It is only relevant in that it is\\nconnected with piloting. There used to be an excellent pilot on the\\nriver, a Mr. X., who was a somnambulist. It was said that if his mind\\nwas troubled about a bad piece of river, he was pretty sure to get up\\nand walk in his sleep and do strange things. He was once fellow-pilot\\nfor a trip or two with George Ealer, on a great New Orleans passenger\\npacket. During a considerable part of the first trip George was uneasy,\\nbut got over it by and by, as X. seemed content to stay in his bed when\\nasleep. Late one night the boat was approaching Helena, Arkansas; the\\nwater was low, and the crossing above the town in a very blind and\\ntangled condition. X. had seen the crossing since Ealer had, and as the\\nnight was particularly drizzly, sullen, and dark, Ealer was considering\\nwhether he had not better have X. called to assist in running the place,\\nwhen the door opened and X. walked in. Now on very dark nights, light is\\na deadly enemy to piloting; you are aware that if you stand in a lighted\\nroom, on such a night, you cannot see things in the street to any\\npurpose; but if you put out the lights and stand in the gloom you can\\nmake out objects in the street pretty well. So, on very dark nights,\\npilots do not smoke; they allow no fire in the pilot-house stove if\\nthere is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape; they order the\\nfurnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the sky-lights to\\nbe closely blinded. Then no light whatever issues from the boat. The\\nundefinable shape that now entered the pilot-house had Mr. X.'s voice.\\nThis said--\\n\\n'Let me take her, George; I've seen this place since you have, and it\\nis so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself easier than I could tell\\nyou how to do it.'\\n\\n'It is kind of you, and I swear _I_ am willing. I haven't got another\\ndrop of perspiration left in me. I have been spinning around and around\\nthe wheel like a squirrel. It is so dark I can't tell which way she is\\nswinging till she is coming around like a whirligig.'\\n\\nSo Ealer took a seat on the bench, panting and breathless. The black\\nphantom assumed the wheel without saying anything, steadied the waltzing\\nsteamer with a turn or two, and then stood at ease, coaxing her a little\\nto this side and then to that, as gently and as sweetly as if the time\\nhad been noonday. When Ealer observed this marvel of steering, he wished\\nhe had not confessed! He stared, and wondered, and finally said--\\n\\n'Well, I thought I knew how to steer a steamboat, but that was another\\nmistake of mine.'\\n\\nX. said nothing, but went serenely on with his work. He rang for the\\nleads; he rang to slow down the steam; he worked the boat carefully and\\nneatly into invisible marks, then stood at the center of the wheel\\nand peered blandly out into the blackness, fore and aft, to verify his\\nposition; as the leads shoaled more and more, he stopped the engines\\nentirely, and the dead silence and suspense of 'drifting' followed when\\nthe shoalest water was struck, he cracked on the steam, carried her\\nhandsomely over, and then began to work her warily into the next system\\nof shoal marks; the same patient, heedful use of leads and engines\\nfollowed, the boat slipped through without touching bottom, and entered\\nupon the third and last intricacy of the crossing; imperceptibly\\nshe moved through the gloom, crept by inches into her marks, drifted\\ntediously till the shoalest water was cried, and then, under a\\ntremendous head of steam, went swinging over the reef and away into deep\\nwater and safety!\\n\\nEaler let his long-pent breath pour out in a great, relieving sigh, and\\nsaid--\\n\\n'That's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done on the\\nMississippi River! I wouldn't believed it could be done, if I hadn't\\nseen it.'\\n\\nThere was no reply, and he added--\\n\\n'Just hold her five minutes longer, partner, and let me run down and get\\na cup of coffee.'\\n\\nA minute later Ealer was biting into a pie, down in the 'texas,' and\\ncomforting himself with coffee. Just then the night watchman happened\\nin, and was about to happen out again, when he noticed Ealer and\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n'Who is at the wheel, sir?'\\n\\n'X.'\\n\\n'Dart for the pilot-house, quicker than lightning!'\\n\\nThe next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house companion way,\\nthree steps at a jump! Nobody there! The great steamer was whistling\\ndown the middle of the river at her own sweet will! The watchman shot\\nout of the place again; Ealer seized the wheel, set an engine back with\\npower, and held his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from\\na 'towhead' which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf of\\nMexico!\\n\\nBy and by the watchman came back and said--\\n\\n'Didn't that lunatic tell you he was asleep, when he first came up\\nhere?'\\n\\n'_No_.'\\n\\n'Well, he was. I found him walking along on top of the railings just as\\nunconcerned as another man would walk a pavement; and I put him to bed;\\nnow just this minute there he was again, away astern, going through that\\nsort of tight-rope deviltry the same as before.'\\n\\n'Well, I think I'll stay by, next time he has one of those fits. But I\\nhope he'll have them often. You just ought to have seen him take this\\nboat through Helena crossing. I never saw anything so gaudy before. And\\nif he can do such gold-leaf, kid-glove, diamond-breastpin piloting when\\nhe is sound asleep, what _couldn't_ he do if he was dead!'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 12\\n\\nSounding\\n\\nWHEN the river is very low, and one's steamboat is 'drawing all the\\nwater' there is in the channel,--or a few inches more, as was often\\nthe case in the old times,--one must be painfully circumspect in his\\npiloting. We used to have to 'sound' a number of particularly bad places\\nalmost every trip when the river was at a very low stage.\\n\\nSounding is done in this way. The boat ties up at the shore, just above\\nthe shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch takes his 'cub' or steersman\\nand a picked crew of men (sometimes an officer also), and goes out in\\nthe yawl--provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous luxury, a\\nregularly-devised 'sounding-boat'--and proceeds to hunt for the best\\nwater, the pilot on duty watching his movements through a spy-glass,\\nmeantime, and in some instances assisting by signals of the boat's\\nwhistle, signifying 'try higher up' or 'try lower down;' for the surface\\nof the water, like an oil-painting, is more expressive and intelligible\\nwhen inspected from a little distance than very close at hand. The\\nwhistle signals are seldom necessary, however; never, perhaps, except\\nwhen the wind confuses the significant ripples upon the water's surface.\\nWhen the yawl has reached the shoal place, the speed is slackened, the\\npilot begins to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long,\\nand the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to 'hold her up to\\nstarboard;' or, 'let her fall off to larboard;'{footnote [The term\\n'larboard' is never used at sea now, to signify the left hand; but was\\nalways used on the river in my time]} or 'steady--steady as you go.'\\n\\nWhen the measurements indicate that the yawl is approaching the shoalest\\npart of the reef, the command is given to 'ease all!' Then the men stop\\nrowing and the yawl drifts with the current. The next order is, 'Stand\\nby with the buoy!' The moment the shallowest point is reached, the pilot\\ndelivers the order, 'Let go the buoy!' and over she goes. If the pilot\\nis not satisfied, he sounds the place again; if he finds better water\\nhigher up or lower down, he removes the buoy to that place. Being\\nfinally satisfied, he gives the order, and all the men stand their\\noars straight up in the air, in line; a blast from the boat's whistle\\nindicates that the signal has been seen; then the men 'give way' on\\ntheir oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy; the steamer comes\\ncreeping carefully down, is pointed straight at the buoy, husbands her\\npower for the coming struggle, and presently, at the critical moment,\\nturns on all her steam and goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and\\nthe sand, and gains the deep water beyond. Or maybe she doesn't; maybe\\nshe 'strikes and swings.' Then she has to while away several hours (or\\ndays) sparring herself off.\\n\\nSometimes a buoy is not laid at all, but the yawl goes ahead, hunting\\nthe best water, and the steamer follows along in its wake. Often there\\nis a deal of fun and excitement about sounding, especially if it is a\\nglorious summer day, or a blustering night. But in winter the cold and\\nthe peril take most of the fun out of it.\\n\\nA buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long, with one end\\nturned up; it is a reversed school-house bench, with one of the supports\\nleft and the other removed. It is anchored on the shoalest part of the\\nreef by a rope with a heavy stone made fast to the end of it. But for\\nthe resistance of the turned-up end of the reversed bench, the current\\nwould pull the buoy under water. At night, a paper lantern with a candle\\nin it is fastened on top of the buoy, and this can be seen a mile or\\nmore, a little glimmering spark in the waste of blackness.\\n\\nNothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go out sounding.\\nThere is such an air of adventure about it; often there is danger; it is\\nso gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the stern-sheets and steer\\na swift yawl; there is something fine about the exultant spring of the\\nboat when an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the\\noars; it is lovely to see the white foam stream away from the bows;\\nthere is music in the rush of the water; it is deliciously exhilarating,\\nin summer, to go speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the\\nworld of wavelets is dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur, too, to\\nthe cub, to get a chance to give an order; for often the pilot will\\nsimply say, 'Let her go about!' and leave the rest to the cub, who\\ninstantly cries, in his sternest tone of command, 'Ease starboard!\\nStrong on the larboard! Starboard give way! With a will, men!' The cub\\nenjoys sounding for the further reason that the eyes of the passengers\\nare watching all the yawl's movements with absorbing interest if the\\ntime be daylight; and if it be night he knows that those same wondering\\neyes are fastened upon the yawl's lantern as it glides out into the\\ngloom and dims away in the remote distance.\\n\\nOne trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our pilot-house with\\nher uncle and aunt, every day and all day long. I fell in love with her.\\nSo did Mr. Thornburg's cub, Tom G----. Tom and I had been bosom friends\\nuntil this time; but now a coolness began to arise. I told the girl a\\ngood many of my river adventures, and made myself out a good deal of a\\nhero; Tom tried to make himself appear to be a hero, too, and succeeded\\nto some extent, but then he always had a way of embroidering. However,\\nvirtue is its own reward, so I was a barely perceptible trifle ahead\\nin the contest. About this time something happened which promised\\nhandsomely for me: the pilots decided to sound the crossing at the head\\nof 21. This would occur about nine or ten o'clock at night, when\\nthe passengers would be still up; it would be Mr. Thornburg's watch,\\ntherefore my chief would have to do the sounding. We had a perfect love\\nof a sounding-boat--long, trim, graceful, and as fleet as a greyhound;\\nher thwarts were cushioned; she carried twelve oarsmen; one of the mates\\nwas always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew, for ours was a\\nsteamer where no end of 'style' was put on.\\n\\nWe tied up at the shore above 21, and got ready. It was a foul night,\\nand the river was so wide, there, that a landsman's uneducated eyes\\ncould discern no opposite shore through such a gloom. The passengers\\nwere alert and interested; everything was satisfactory. As I hurried\\nthrough the engine-room, picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery, I met\\nTom, and could not forbear delivering myself of a mean speech--\\n\\n'Ain't you glad _you _don't have to go out sounding?'\\n\\nTom was passing on, but he quickly turned, and said--\\n\\n'Now just for that, you can go and get the sounding-pole yourself. I was\\ngoing after it, but I'd see you in Halifax, now, before I'd do it.'\\n\\n'Who wants you to get it? I don't. It's in the sounding-boat.'\\n\\n'It ain't, either. It's been new-painted; and it's been up on the\\nladies' cabin guards two days, drying.'\\n\\nI flew back, and shortly arrived among the crowd of watching and\\nwondering ladies just in time to hear the command:\\n\\n'Give way, men!'\\n\\nI looked over, and there was the gallant sounding-boat booming away, the\\nunprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller, and my chief sitting by him\\nwith the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool's errand to\\nfetch. Then that young girl said to me--\\n\\n'Oh, how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a night! Do\\nyou think there is any danger?'\\n\\nI would rather have been stabbed. I went off, full of venom, to help in\\nthe pilot-house. By and by the boat's lantern disappeared, and after an\\ninterval a wee spark glimmered upon the face of the water a mile away.\\nMr. Thornburg blew the whistle, in acknowledgment, backed the steamer\\nout, and made for it. We flew along for a while, then slackened steam\\nand went cautiously gliding toward the spark. Presently Mr. Thornburg\\nexclaimed--\\n\\n'Hello, the buoy-lantern's out!'\\n\\nHe stopped the engines. A moment or two later he said--\\n\\n'Why, there it is again!'\\n\\nSo he came ahead on the engines once more, and rang for the leads.\\nGradually the water shoaled up, and then began to deepen again! Mr.\\nThornburg muttered--\\n\\n'Well, I don't understand this. I believe that buoy has drifted off the\\nreef. Seems to be a little too far to the left. No matter, it is safest\\nto run over it anyhow.'\\n\\nSo, in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down on the light.\\nJust as our bows were in the act of plowing over it, Mr. Thornburg\\nseized the bell-ropes, rang a startling peal, and exclaimed--\\n\\n'My soul, it's the sounding-boat!'\\n\\nA sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below--a pause--and then\\nthe sound of grinding and crashing followed. Mr. Thornburg exclaimed--\\n\\n'There! the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat to lucifer\\nmatches! Run! See who is killed!'\\n\\nI was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye. My chief and the\\nthird mate and nearly all the men were safe. They had discovered their\\ndanger when it was too late to pull out of the way; then, when the great\\nguards overshadowed them a moment later, they were prepared and knew\\nwhat to do; at my chiefs order they sprang at the right instant, seized\\nthe guard, and were hauled aboard. The next moment the sounding-yawl\\nswept aft to the wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms. Two of\\nthe men and the cub Tom, were missing--a fact which spread like wildfire\\nover the boat. The passengers came flocking to the forward gangway,\\nladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced, and talked in awed voices of\\nthe dreadful thing. And often and again I heard them say, 'Poor fellows!\\npoor boy, poor boy!'\\n\\nBy this time the boat's yawl was manned and away, to search for the\\nmissing. Now a faint call was heard, off to the left. The yawl had\\ndisappeared in the other direction. Half the people rushed to one side\\nto encourage the swimmer with their shouts; the other half rushed the\\nother way to shriek to the yawl to turn about. By the callings,\\nthe swimmer was approaching, but some said the sound showed failing\\nstrength. The crowd massed themselves against the boiler-deck railings,\\nleaning over and staring into the gloom; and every faint and fainter cry\\nwrung from them such words as, 'Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow! is there\\nno way to save him?'\\n\\nBut still the cries held out, and drew nearer, and presently the voice\\nsaid pluckily--\\n\\n'I can make it! Stand by with a rope!'\\n\\nWhat a rousing cheer they gave him! The chief mate took his stand in the\\nglare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope in his hand, and his men grouped\\nabout him. The next moment the swimmer's face appeared in the circle of\\nlight, and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard, limp and\\ndrenched, while cheer on cheer went up. It was that devil Tom.\\n\\nThe yawl crew searched everywhere, but found no sign of the two men.\\nThey probably failed to catch the guard, tumbled back, and were struck\\nby the wheel and killed. Tom had never jumped for the guard at all, but\\nhad plunged head-first into the river and dived under the wheel. It was\\nnothing; I could have done it easy enough, and I said so; but everybody\\nwent on just the same, making a wonderful to do over that ass, as if he\\nhad done something great. That girl couldn't seem to have enough of that\\npitiful 'hero' the rest of the trip; but little I cared; I loathed her,\\nany way.\\n\\nThe way we came to mistake the sounding-boat's lantern for the\\nbuoy-light was this. My chief said that after laying the buoy he fell\\naway and watched it till it seemed to be secure; then he took up a\\nposition a hundred yards below it and a little to one side of the\\nsteamer's course, headed the sounding-boat up-stream, and waited. Having\\nto wait some time, he and the officer got to talking; he looked up when\\nhe judged that the steamer was about on the reef; saw that the buoy was\\ngone, but supposed that the steamer had already run over it; he went\\non with his talk; he noticed that the steamer was getting very close on\\nhim, but that was the correct thing; it was her business to shave him\\nclosely, for convenience in taking him aboard; he was expecting her to\\nsheer off, until the last moment; then it flashed upon him that she was\\ntrying to run him down, mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light; so he\\nsang out, 'Stand by to spring for the guard, men!' and the next instant\\nthe jump was made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13\\n\\nA Pilot's Needs\\n\\nBUT I am wandering from what I was intending to do, that is, make\\nplainer than perhaps appears in the previous chapters, some of the\\npeculiar requirements of the science of piloting. First of all, there\\nis one faculty which a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has\\nbrought it to absolute perfection. Nothing short of perfection will do.\\nThat faculty is memory. He cannot stop with merely thinking a thing is\\nso and so; he must know it; for this is eminently one of the 'exact'\\nsciences. With what scorn a pilot was looked upon, in the old times, if\\nhe ever ventured to deal in that feeble phrase 'I think,' instead of the\\nvigorous one 'I know!' One cannot easily realize what a tremendous thing\\nit is to know every trivial detail of twelve hundred miles of river and\\nknow it with absolute exactness. If you will take the longest street\\nin New York, and travel up and down it, conning its features patiently\\nuntil you know every house and window and door and lamp-post and big and\\nlittle sign by heart, and know them so accurately that you can instantly\\nname the one you are abreast of when you are set down at random in\\nthat street in the middle of an inky black night, you will then have a\\ntolerable notion of the amount and the exactness of a pilot's knowledge\\nwho carries the Mississippi River in his head. And then if you will\\ngo on until you know every street crossing, the character, size, and\\nposition of the crossing-stones, and the varying depth of mud in each of\\nthose numberless places, you will have some idea of what the pilot must\\nknow in order to keep a Mississippi steamer out of trouble. Next, if\\nyou will take half of the signs in that long street, and _change their\\nplaces_ once a month, and still manage to know their new positions\\naccurately on dark nights, and keep up with these repeated changes\\nwithout making any mistakes, you will understand what is required of a\\npilot's peerless memory by the fickle Mississippi.\\n\\nI think a pilot's memory is about the most wonderful thing in the world.\\nTo know the Old and New Testaments by heart, and be able to recite them\\nglibly, forward or backward, or begin at random anywhere in the book\\nand recite both ways and never trip or make a mistake, is no extravagant\\nmass of knowledge, and no marvelous facility, compared to a pilot's\\nmassed knowledge of the Mississippi and his marvelous facility in the\\nhandling of it. I make this comparison deliberately, and believe I am\\nnot expanding the truth when I do it. Many will think my figure too\\nstrong, but pilots will not.\\n\\nAnd how easily and comfortably the pilot's memory does its work; how\\nplacidly effortless is its way; how _unconsciously _it lays up its vast\\nstores, hour by hour, day by day, and never loses or mislays a single\\nvaluable package of them all! Take an instance. Let a leadsman cry,\\n'Half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain!' until\\nit become as monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let conversation be\\ngoing on all the time, and the pilot be doing his share of the talking,\\nand no longer consciously listening to the leadsman; and in the midst\\nof this endless string of half twains let a single 'quarter twain!' be\\ninterjected, without emphasis, and then the half twain cry go on again,\\njust as before: two or three weeks later that pilot can describe with\\nprecision the boat's position in the river when that quarter twain\\nwas uttered, and give you such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks, and\\nside-marks to guide you, that you ought to be able to take the boat\\nthere and put her in that same spot again yourself! The cry of 'quarter\\ntwain' did not really take his mind from his talk, but his trained\\nfaculties instantly photographed the bearings, noted the change of\\ndepth, and laid up the important details for future reference without\\nrequiring any assistance from him in the matter. If you were walking\\nand talking with a friend, and another friend at your side kept up a\\nmonotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a couple of blocks, and\\nthen in the midst interjected an R, thus, A, A, A, A, A, R, A, A, A,\\netc., and gave the R no emphasis, you would not be able to state, two or\\nthree weeks afterward, that the R had been put in, nor be able to tell\\nwhat objects you were passing at the moment it was done. But you could\\nif your memory had been patiently and laboriously trained to do that\\nsort of thing mechanically.\\n\\nGive a man a tolerably fair memory to start with, and piloting will\\ndevelop it into a very colossus of capability. But _only in the matters\\nit is daily drilled in_. A time would come when the man's faculties\\ncould not help noticing landmarks and soundings, and his memory could\\nnot help holding on to them with the grip of a vise; but if you asked\\nthat same man at noon what he had had for breakfast, it would be ten\\nchances to one that he could not tell you. Astonishing things can be\\ndone with the human memory if you will devote it faithfully to one\\nparticular line of business.\\n\\nAt the time that wages soared so high on the Missouri River, my chief,\\nMr. Bixby, went up there and learned more than a thousand miles of that\\nstream with an ease and rapidity that were astonishing. When he had seen\\neach division once in the daytime and once at night, his education was\\nso nearly complete that he took out a 'daylight' license; a few\\ntrips later he took out a full license, and went to piloting day and\\nnight--and he ranked A 1, too.\\n\\nMr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot whose feats\\nof memory were a constant marvel to me. However, his memory was born in\\nhim, I think, not built. For instance, somebody would mention a name.\\nInstantly Mr. Brown would break in--\\n\\n'Oh, I knew _him_. Sallow-faced, red-headed fellow, with a little scar\\non the side of his throat, like a splinter under the flesh. He was only\\nin the Southern trade six months. That was thirteen years ago. I made a\\ntrip with him. There was five feet in the upper river then; the “Henry\\nBlake” grounded at the foot of Tower Island drawing four and a half; the\\n“George Elliott” unshipped her rudder on the wreck of the “Sunflower”--'\\n\\n'Why, the “Sunflower” didn't sink until--'\\n\\n'I know when she sunk; it was three years before that, on the 2nd of\\nDecember; Asa Hardy was captain of her, and his brother John was first\\nclerk; and it was his first trip in her, too; Tom Jones told me these\\nthings a week afterward in New Orleans; he was first mate of the\\n“Sunflower.” Captain Hardy stuck a nail in his foot the 6th of July of\\nthe next year, and died of the lockjaw on the 15th. His brother died\\ntwo years after 3rd of March,--erysipelas. I never saw either of the\\nHardys,--they were Alleghany River men,--but people who knew them told\\nme all these things. And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn socks winter\\nand summer just the same, and his first wife's name was Jane Shook--she\\nwas from New England--and his second one died in a lunatic asylum. It\\nwas in the blood. She was from Lexington, Kentucky. Name was Horton\\nbefore she was married.'\\n\\nAnd so on, by the hour, the man's tongue would go. He could _not _forget\\nany thing. It was simply impossible. The most trivial details remained\\nas distinct and luminous in his head, after they had lain there for\\nyears, as the most memorable events. His was not simply a pilot's\\nmemory; its grasp was universal. If he were talking about a trifling\\nletter he had received seven years before, he was pretty sure to deliver\\nyou the entire screed from memory. And then without observing that he\\nwas departing from the true line of his talk, he was more than likely\\nto hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that\\nletter; and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer's\\nrelatives, one by one, and give you their biographies, too.\\n\\nSuch a memory as that is a great misfortune. To it, all occurrences\\nare of the same size. Its possessor cannot distinguish an interesting\\ncircumstance from an uninteresting one. As a talker, he is bound to clog\\nhis narrative with tiresome details and make himself an insufferable\\nbore. Moreover, he cannot stick to his subject. He picks up every little\\ngrain of memory he discerns in his way, and so is led aside. Mr. Brown\\nwould start out with the honest intention of telling you a vastly funny\\nanecdote about a dog. He would be 'so full of laugh' that he could\\nhardly begin; then his memory would start with the dog's breed and\\npersonal appearance; drift into a history of his owner; of his owner's\\nfamily, with descriptions of weddings and burials that had occurred in\\nit, together with recitals of congratulatory verses and obituary poetry\\nprovoked by the same: then this memory would recollect that one of these\\nevents occurred during the celebrated 'hard winter' of such and such a\\nyear, and a minute description of that winter would follow, along with\\nthe names of people who were frozen to death, and statistics showing the\\nhigh figures which pork and hay went up to. Pork and hay would suggest\\ncorn and fodder; corn and fodder would suggest cows and horses; cows and\\nhorses would suggest the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders;\\nthe transition from the circus to the menagerie was easy and natural;\\nfrom the elephant to equatorial Africa was but a step; then of course\\nthe heathen savages would suggest religion; and at the end of three or\\nfour hours' tedious jaw, the watch would change, and Brown would go out\\nof the pilot-house muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years\\nbefore about the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace. And the\\noriginal first mention would be all you had learned about that dog,\\nafter all this waiting and hungering.\\n\\nA pilot must have a memory; but there are two higher qualities which he\\nmust also have. He must have good and quick judgment and decision, and a\\ncool, calm courage that no peril can shake. Give a man the merest trifle\\nof pluck to start with, and by the time he has become a pilot he cannot\\nbe unmanned by any danger a steamboat can get into; but one cannot quite\\nsay the same for judgment. Judgment is a matter of brains, and a man\\nmust _start _with a good stock of that article or he will never succeed\\nas a pilot.\\n\\nThe growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time, but it\\ndoes not reach a high and satisfactory condition until some time after\\nthe young pilot has been 'standing his own watch,' alone and under\\nthe staggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the\\nposition. When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted\\nwith the river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his\\nsteamboat, night or day, that he presently begins to imagine that it is\\n_his _courage that animates him; but the first time the pilot steps out\\nand leaves him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man's.\\nHe discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo\\naltogether. The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a moment;\\nhe is not prepared for them; he does not know how to meet them; all his\\nknowledge forsakes him; and within fifteen minutes he is as white as a\\nsheet and scared almost to death. Therefore pilots wisely train these\\ncubs by various strategic tricks to look danger in the face a little\\nmore calmly. A favorite way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon\\nthe candidate.\\n\\nMr. Bixby served me in this fashion once, and for years afterward I\\nused to blush even in my sleep when I thought of it. I had become a good\\nsteersman; so good, indeed, that I had all the work to do on our watch,\\nnight and day; Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me; all he ever did\\nwas to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in particularly bad\\ncrossings, land the boat when she needed to be landed, play gentleman of\\nleisure nine-tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The lower river\\nwas about bank-full, and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any\\ncrossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or instruction,\\nI should have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of being afraid of any\\ncrossing in the lot, in the _day-time_, was a thing too preposterous for\\ncontemplation. Well, one matchless summer's day I was bowling down the\\nbend above island 66, brimful of self-conceit and carrying my nose as\\nhigh as a giraffe's, when Mr. Bixby said--\\n\\n'I am going below a while. I suppose you know the next crossing?'\\n\\nThis was almost an affront. It was about the plainest and simplest\\ncrossing in the whole river. One couldn't come to any harm, whether he\\nran it right or not; and as for depth, there never had been any bottom\\nthere. I knew all this, perfectly well.\\n\\n'Know how to _run _it? Why, I can run it with my eyes shut.'\\n\\n'How much water is there in it?'\\n\\n'Well, that is an odd question. I couldn't get bottom there with a\\nchurch steeple.'\\n\\n'You think so, do you?'\\n\\nThe very tone of the question shook my confidence. That was what Mr.\\nBixby was expecting. He left, without saying anything more. I began to\\nimagine all sorts of things. Mr. Bixby, unknown to me, of course, sent\\nsomebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the\\nleadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers,\\nand then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could\\nobserve results. Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane\\ndeck; next the chief mate appeared; then a clerk. Every moment or two a\\nstraggler was added to my audience; and before I got to the head of\\nthe island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my\\nnose. I began to wonder what the trouble was. As I started across, the\\ncaptain glanced aloft at me and said, with a sham uneasiness in his\\nvoice--\\n\\n'Where is Mr. Bixby?'\\n\\n'Gone below, sir.'\\n\\nBut that did the business for me. My imagination began to construct\\ndangers out of nothing, and they multiplied faster than I could keep the\\nrun of them. All at once I imagined I saw shoal water ahead! The wave\\nof coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every\\njoint in me. All my confidence in that crossing vanished. I seized the\\nbell-rope; dropped it, ashamed; seized it again; dropped it once more;\\nclutched it tremblingly one again, and pulled it so feebly that I could\\nhardly hear the stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out instantly, and\\nboth together--\\n\\n'Starboard lead there! and quick about it!'\\n\\nThis was another shock. I began to climb the wheel like a squirrel;\\nbut I would hardly get the boat started to port before I would see new\\ndangers on that side, and away I would spin to the other; only to find\\nperils accumulating to starboard, and be crazy to get to port again.\\nThen came the leadsman's sepulchral cry--\\n\\n'D-e-e-p four!'\\n\\nDeep four in a bottomless crossing! The terror of it took my breath\\naway.\\n\\n'M-a-r-k three!... M-a-r-k three... Quarter less three!... Half twain!'\\n\\nThis was frightful! I seized the bell-ropes and stopped the engines.\\n\\n'Quarter twain! Quarter twain! _Mark _twain!'\\n\\nI was helpless. I did not know what in the world to do. I was quaking\\nfrom head to foot, and I could have hung my hat on my eyes, they stuck\\nout so far.\\n\\n'Quarter _less _twain! Nine and a _half_!'\\n\\nWe were _drawing _nine! My hands were in a nerveless flutter. I could\\nnot ring a bell intelligibly with them. I flew to the speaking-tube and\\nshouted to the engineer--\\n\\n'Oh, Ben, if you love me, _back _her! Quick, Ben! Oh, back the immortal\\n_soul_ out of her!'\\n\\nI heard the door close gently. I looked around, and there stood Mr.\\nBixby, smiling a bland, sweet smile. Then the audience on the hurricane\\ndeck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter. I saw it all, now,\\nand I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history. I laid in the\\nlead, set the boat in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said--\\n\\n'It was a fine trick to play on an orphan, _wasn't_ it? I suppose I'll\\nnever hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave the lead at the\\nhead of 66.'\\n\\n'Well, no, you won't, maybe. In fact I hope you won't; for I want you\\nto learn something by that experience. Didn't you _know _there was no\\nbottom in that crossing?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir, I did.'\\n\\n'Very well, then. You shouldn't have allowed me or anybody else to shake\\nyour confidence in that knowledge. Try to remember that. And another\\nthing: when you get into a dangerous place, don't turn coward. That\\nisn't going to help matters any.'\\n\\nIt was a good enough lesson, but pretty hardly learned. Yet about the\\nhardest part of it was that for months I so often had to hear a phrase\\nwhich I had conceived a particular distaste for. It was, 'Oh, Ben, if\\nyou love me, back her!'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 14\\n\\nRank and Dignity of Piloting\\n\\nIN my preceding chapters I have tried, by going into the minutiae of the\\nscience of piloting, to carry the reader step by step to a comprehension\\nof what the science consists of; and at the same time I have tried to\\nshow him that it is a very curious and wonderful science, too, and very\\nworthy of his attention. If I have seemed to love my subject, it is no\\nsurprising thing, for I loved the profession far better than any I have\\nfollowed since, and I took a measureless pride in it. The reason is\\nplain: a pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely\\nindependent human being that lived in the earth. Kings are but the\\nhampered servants of parliament and people; parliaments sit in chains\\nforged by their constituency; the editor of a newspaper cannot be\\nindependent, but must work with one hand tied behind him by party and\\npatrons, and be content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind; no\\nclergyman is a free man and may speak the whole truth, regardless of\\nhis parish's opinions; writers of all kinds are manacled servants of the\\npublic. We write frankly and fearlessly, but then we 'modify' before we\\nprint. In truth, every man and woman and child has a master, and worries\\nand frets in servitude; but in the day I write of, the Mississippi pilot\\nhad none. The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck, in the pomp\\nof a very brief authority, and give him five or six orders while the\\nvessel backed into the stream, and then that skipper's reign was over.\\n\\nThe moment that the boat was under way in the river, she was under the\\nsole and unquestioned control of the pilot. He could do with her exactly\\nas he pleased, run her when and whither he chose, and tie her up to the\\nbank whenever his judgment said that that course was best. His movements\\nwere entirely free; he consulted no one, he received commands from\\nnobody, he promptly resented even the merest suggestions. Indeed,\\nthe law of the United States forbade him to listen to commands or\\nsuggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily knew better\\nhow to handle the boat than anybody could tell him. So here was the\\nnovelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute monarch who was absolute\\nin sober truth and not by a fiction of words. I have seen a boy of\\neighteen taking a great steamer serenely into what seemed almost certain\\ndestruction, and the aged captain standing mutely by, filled with\\napprehension but powerless to interfere. His interference, in that\\nparticular instance, might have been an excellent thing, but to permit\\nit would have been to establish a most pernicious precedent. It will\\neasily be guessed, considering the pilot's boundless authority, that he\\nwas a great personage in the old steamboating days. He was treated with\\nmarked courtesy by the captain and with marked deference by all\\nthe officers and servants; and this deferential spirit was quickly\\ncommunicated to the passengers, too. I think pilots were about the only\\npeople I ever knew who failed to show, in some degree, embarrassment in\\nthe presence of traveling foreign princes. But then, people in one's own\\ngrade of life are not usually embarrassing objects.\\n\\nBy long habit, pilots came to put all their wishes in the form of\\ncommands. It 'gravels' me, to this day, to put my will in the weak shape\\nof a request, instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order.\\nIn those old days, to load a steamboat at St. Louis, take her to New\\nOrleans and back, and discharge cargo, consumed about twenty-five\\ndays, on an average. Seven or eight of these days the boat spent at the\\nwharves of St. Louis and New Orleans, and every soul on board was hard\\nat work, except the two pilots; they did nothing but play gentleman up\\ntown, and receive the same wages for it as if they had been on duty. The\\nmoment the boat touched the wharf at either city, they were ashore; and\\nthey were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing and\\neverything in readiness for another voyage.\\n\\nWhen a captain got hold of a pilot of particularly high reputation, he\\ntook pains to keep him. When wages were four hundred dollars a month on\\nthe Upper Mississippi, I have known a captain to keep such a pilot in\\nidleness, under full pay, three months at a time, while the river was\\nfrozen up. And one must remember that in those cheap times four hundred\\ndollars was a salary of almost inconceivable splendor. Few men on shore\\ngot such pay as that, and when they did they were mightily looked up\\nto. When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our small\\nMissouri village, they were sought by the best and the fairest, and\\ntreated with exalted respect. Lying in port under wages was a thing\\nwhich many pilots greatly enjoyed and appreciated; especially if they\\nbelonged in the Missouri River in the heyday of that trade (Kansas\\ntimes), and got nine hundred dollars a trip, which was equivalent to\\nabout eighteen hundred dollars a month. Here is a conversation of that\\nday. A chap out of the Illinois River, with a little stern-wheel tub,\\naccosts a couple of ornate and gilded Missouri River pilots--\\n\\n'Gentlemen, I've got a pretty good trip for the upcountry, and shall\\nwant you about a month. How much will it be?'\\n\\n'Eighteen hundred dollars apiece.'\\n\\n'Heavens and earth! You take my boat, let me have your wages, and I'll\\ndivide!'\\n\\nI will remark, in passing, that Mississippi steamboatmen were important\\nin landsmen's eyes (and in their own, too, in a degree) according to the\\ndignity of the boat they were on. For instance, it was a proud thing to\\nbe of the crew of such stately craft as the 'Aleck Scott' or the 'Grand\\nTurk.' Negro firemen, deck hands, and barbers belonging to those boats\\nwere distinguished personages in their grade of life, and they were well\\naware of that fact too. A stalwart darkey once gave offense at a negro\\nball in New Orleans by putting on a good many airs. Finally one of the\\nmanagers bustled up to him and said--\\n\\n'Who _is_ you, any way? Who is you? dat's what I wants to know!'\\n\\nThe offender was not disconcerted in the least, but swelled himself\\nup and threw that into his voice which showed that he knew he was not\\nputting on all those airs on a stinted capital.\\n\\n'Who _is_ I? Who _is _I? I let you know mighty quick who I is! I want\\nyou niggers to understan' dat I fires de middle do'{footnote [Door]} on\\nde “Aleck Scott!”'\\n\\nThat was sufficient.\\n\\nThe barber of the 'Grand Turk' was a spruce young negro, who aired his\\nimportance with balmy complacency, and was greatly courted by the circle\\nin which he moved. The young colored population of New Orleans were much\\ngiven to flirting, at twilight, on the banquettes of the back streets.\\nSomebody saw and heard something like the following, one evening, in\\none of those localities. A middle-aged negro woman projected her head\\nthrough a broken pane and shouted (very willing that the neighbors\\nshould hear and envy), 'You Mary Ann, come in de house dis minute!\\nStannin' out dah foolin' 'long wid dat low trash, an' heah's de barber\\noffn de “Gran' Turk” wants to conwerse wid you!'\\n\\nMy reference, a moment ago, to the fact that a pilot's peculiar official\\nposition placed him out of the reach of criticism or command, brings\\nStephen W---- naturally to my mind. He was a gifted pilot, a good\\nfellow, a tireless talker, and had both wit and humor in him. He had a\\nmost irreverent independence, too, and was deliciously easy-going and\\ncomfortable in the presence of age, official dignity, and even the most\\naugust wealth. He always had work, he never saved a penny, he was a most\\npersuasive borrower, he was in debt to every pilot on the river, and to\\nthe majority of the captains. He could throw a sort of splendor around\\na bit of harum-scarum, devil-may-care piloting, that made it almost\\nfascinating--but not to everybody. He made a trip with good old Captain\\nY----once, and was 'relieved' from duty when the boat got to New\\nOrleans. Somebody expressed surprise at the discharge. Captain Y----\\nshuddered at the mere mention of Stephen. Then his poor, thin old voice\\npiped out something like this:--\\n\\n'Why, bless me! I wouldn't have such a wild creature on my boat for the\\nworld--not for the whole world! He swears, he sings, he whistles, he\\nyells--I never saw such an Injun to yell. All times of the night--it\\nnever made any difference to him. He would just yell that way, not for\\nanything in particular, but merely on account of a kind of devilish\\ncomfort he got out of it. I never could get into a sound sleep but\\nhe would fetch me out of bed, all in a cold sweat, with one of those\\ndreadful war-whoops. A queer being--very queer being; no respect for\\nanything or anybody. Sometimes he called me “Johnny.” And he kept a\\nfiddle, and a cat. He played execrably. This seemed to distress the cat,\\nand so the cat would howl. Nobody could sleep where that man--and his\\nfamily--was. And reckless. There never was anything like it. Now you may\\nbelieve it or not, but as sure as I am sitting here, he brought my boat\\na-tilting down through those awful snags at Chicot under a rattling\\nhead of steam, and the wind a-blowing like the very nation, at that! My\\nofficers will tell you so. They saw it. And, sir, while he was a-tearing\\nright down through those snags, and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying,\\nI wish I may never speak again if he didn't pucker up his mouth and go\\nto _whistling_! Yes, sir; whistling “Buffalo gals, can't you come out\\ntonight, can't you come out to-night, can't you come out to-night;” and\\ndoing it as calmly as if we were attending a funeral and weren't related\\nto the corpse. And when I remonstrated with him about it, he smiled down\\non me as if I was his child, and told me to run in the house and try to\\nbe good, and not be meddling with my superiors!'\\n\\nOnce a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans out of work\\nand as usual out of money. He laid steady siege to Stephen, who was in\\na very 'close place,' and finally persuaded him to hire with him at one\\nhundred and twenty-five dollars per month, just half wages, the captain\\nagreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the contempt of all\\nthe guild upon the poor fellow. But the boat was not more than a day out\\nof New Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting\\nof his exploit, and that all the officers had been told. Stephen winced,\\nbut said nothing. About the middle of the afternoon the captain stepped\\nout on the hurricane deck, cast his eye around, and looked a good deal\\nsurprised. He glanced inquiringly aloft at Stephen, but Stephen was\\nwhistling placidly, and attending to business. The captain stood around\\na while in evident discomfort, and once or twice seemed about to make a\\nsuggestion; but the etiquette of the river taught him to avoid that sort\\nof rashness, and so he managed to hold his peace. He chafed and puzzled\\na few minutes longer, then retired to his apartments. But soon he\\nwas out again, and apparently more perplexed than ever. Presently he\\nventured to remark, with deference--\\n\\n'Pretty good stage of the river now, ain't it, sir?'\\n\\n'Well, I should say so! Bank-full _is_ a pretty liberal stage.'\\n\\n'Seems to be a good deal of current here.'\\n\\n'Good deal don't describe it! It's worse than a mill-race.'\\n\\n'Isn't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the middle?'\\n\\n'Yes, I reckon it is; but a body can't be too careful with a steamboat.\\nIt's pretty safe out here; can't strike any bottom here, you can depend\\non that.'\\n\\nThe captain departed, looking rueful enough. At this rate, he would\\nprobably die of old age before his boat got to St. Louis. Next day he\\nappeared on deck and again found Stephen faithfully standing up the\\nmiddle of the river, fighting the whole vast force of the Mississippi,\\nand whistling the same placid tune. This thing was becoming serious.\\nIn by the shore was a slower boat clipping along in the easy water and\\ngaining steadily; she began to make for an island chute; Stephen stuck\\nto the middle of the river. Speech was _wrung _from the captain. He\\nsaid--\\n\\n'Mr. W----, don't that chute cut off a good deal of distance?'\\n\\n'I think it does, but I don't know.'\\n\\n'Don't know! Well, isn't there water enough in it now to go through?'\\n\\n'I expect there is, but I am not certain.'\\n\\n'Upon my word this is odd! Why, those pilots on that boat yonder are\\ngoing to try it. Do you mean to say that you don't know as much as they\\ndo?'\\n\\n'_They_! Why, _they _are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots! But\\ndon't you be uneasy; I know as much as any man can afford to know for a\\nhundred and twenty-five!'\\n\\nThe captain surrendered.\\n\\nFive minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute and showing the\\nrival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pair of heels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 15\\n\\nThe Pilots' Monopoly\\n\\nONE day, on board the 'Aleck Scott,' my chief, Mr. Bixby, was crawling\\ncarefully through a close place at Cat Island, both leads going, and\\neverybody holding his breath. The captain, a nervous, apprehensive man,\\nkept still as long as he could, but finally broke down and shouted from\\nthe hurricane deck--\\n\\n'For gracious' sake, give her steam, Mr. Bixby! give her steam! She'll\\nnever raise the reef on this headway!'\\n\\nFor all the effect that was produced upon Mr. Bixby, one would have\\nsupposed that no remark had been made. But five minutes later, when\\nthe danger was past and the leads laid in, he burst instantly into a\\nconsuming fury, and gave the captain the most admirable cursing I ever\\nlistened to. No bloodshed ensued; but that was because the captain's\\ncause was weak; for ordinarily he was not a man to take correction\\nquietly.\\n\\nHaving now set forth in detail the nature of the science of piloting,\\nand likewise described the rank which the pilot held among the\\nfraternity of steamboatmen, this seems a fitting place to say a few\\nwords about an organization which the pilots once formed for the\\nprotection of their guild. It was curious and noteworthy in this,\\nthat it was perhaps the compactest, the completest, and the strongest\\ncommercial organization ever formed among men.\\n\\nFor a long time wages had been two hundred and fifty dollars a month;\\nbut curiously enough, as steamboats multiplied and business increased,\\nthe wages began to fall little by little. It was easy to discover the\\nreason of this. Too many pilots were being 'made.' It was nice to have\\na 'cub,' a steersman, to do all the hard work for a couple of years,\\ngratis, while his master sat on a high bench and smoked; all pilots and\\ncaptains had sons or nephews who wanted to be pilots. By and by it came\\nto pass that nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman. When a\\nsteersman had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any\\ntwo pilots in the trade, they could get a pilot's license for him by\\nsigning an application directed to the United States Inspector. Nothing\\nfurther was needed; usually no questions were asked, no proofs of\\ncapacity required.\\n\\nVery well, this growing swarm of new pilots presently began to undermine\\nthe wages, in order to get berths. Too late--apparently--the knights of\\nthe tiller perceived their mistake. Plainly, something had to be done,\\nand quickly; but what was to be the needful thing. A close organization.\\nNothing else would answer. To compass this seemed an impossibility; so\\nit was talked, and talked, and then dropped. It was too likely to ruin\\nwhoever ventured to move in the matter. But at last about a dozen of\\nthe boldest--and some of them the best--pilots on the river launched\\nthemselves into the enterprise and took all the chances. They got a\\nspecial charter from the legislature, with large powers, under the name\\nof the Pilots' Benevolent Association; elected their officers, completed\\ntheir organization, contributed capital, put 'association' wages up to\\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars at once--and then retired to their homes,\\nfor they were promptly discharged from employment. But there were two\\nor three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds of\\npropagation in them. For instance, all idle members of the association,\\nin good standing, were entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per\\nmonth. This began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks\\nof the new-fledged pilots, in the dull (summer) season. Better have\\ntwenty-five dollars than starve; the initiation fee was only twelve\\ndollars, and no dues required from the unemployed.\\n\\nAlso, the widows of deceased members in good standing could draw\\ntwenty-five dollars per month, and a certain sum for each of their\\nchildren. Also, the said deceased would be buried at the association's\\nexpense. These things resurrected all the superannuated and forgotten\\npilots in the Mississippi Valley. They came from farms, they came from\\ninterior villages, they came from everywhere. They came on crutches, on\\ndrays, in ambulances,--any way, so they got there. They paid in their\\ntwelve dollars, and straightway began to draw out twenty-five dollars a\\nmonth, and calculate their burial bills.\\n\\nBy and by, all the useless, helpless pilots, and a dozen first-class\\nones, were in the association, and nine-tenths of the best pilots out\\nof it and laughing at it. It was the laughing-stock of the whole river.\\nEverybody joked about the by-law requiring members to pay ten per cent.\\nof their wages, every month, into the treasury for the support of the\\nassociation, whereas all the members were outcast and tabooed, and\\nno one would employ them. Everybody was derisively grateful to the\\nassociation for taking all the worthless pilots out of the way and\\nleaving the whole field to the excellent and the deserving; and\\neverybody was not only jocularly grateful for that, but for a result\\nwhich naturally followed, namely, the gradual advance of wages as the\\nbusy season approached. Wages had gone up from the low figure of one\\nhundred dollars a month to one hundred and twenty-five, and in some\\ncases to one hundred and fifty; and it was great fun to enlarge upon the\\nfact that this charming thing had been accomplished by a body of men not\\none of whom received a particle of benefit from it. Some of the jokers\\nused to call at the association rooms and have a good time chaffing the\\nmembers and offering them the charity of taking them as steersmen for\\na trip, so that they could see what the forgotten river looked like.\\nHowever, the association was content; or at least it gave no sign to the\\ncontrary. Now and then it captured a pilot who was 'out of luck,' and\\nadded him to its list; and these later additions were very valuable,\\nfor they were good pilots; the incompetent ones had all been absorbed\\nbefore. As business freshened, wages climbed gradually up to two hundred\\nand fifty dollars--the association figure--and became firmly fixed\\nthere; and still without benefiting a member of that body, for no member\\nwas hired. The hilarity at the association's expense burst all bounds,\\nnow. There was no end to the fun which that poor martyr had to put up\\nwith.\\n\\nHowever, it is a long lane that has no turning. Winter approached,\\nbusiness doubled and trebled, and an avalanche of Missouri, Illinois and\\nUpper Mississippi River boats came pouring down to take a chance in the\\nNew Orleans trade. All of a sudden pilots were in great demand, and were\\ncorrespondingly scarce. The time for revenge was come. It was a bitter\\npill to have to accept association pilots at last, yet captains and\\nowners agreed that there was no other way. But none of these outcasts\\noffered! So there was a still bitterer pill to be swallowed: they must\\nbe sought out and asked for their services. Captain ---- was the first\\nman who found it necessary to take the dose, and he had been the\\nloudest derider of the organization. He hunted up one of the best of the\\nassociation pilots and said--\\n\\n'Well, you boys have rather got the best of us for a little while, so\\nI'll give in with as good a grace as I can. I've come to hire you; get\\nyour trunk aboard right away. I want to leave at twelve o'clock.'\\n\\n'I don't know about that. Who is your other pilot?'\\n\\n'I've got I. S----. Why?'\\n\\n'I can't go with him. He don't belong to the association.'\\n\\n'What!'\\n\\n'It's so.'\\n\\n'Do you mean to tell me that you won't turn a wheel with one of the\\nvery best and oldest pilots on the river because he don't belong to your\\nassociation?'\\n\\n'Yes, I do.'\\n\\n'Well, if this isn't putting on airs! I supposed I was doing you a\\nbenevolence; but I begin to think that I am the party that wants a favor\\ndone. Are you acting under a law of the concern?'\\n\\n'Yes.'\\n\\n'Show it to me.'\\n\\nSo they stepped into the association rooms, and the secretary soon\\nsatisfied the captain, who said--\\n\\n'Well, what am I to do? I have hired Mr. S---- for the entire season.'\\n\\n'I will provide for you,' said the secretary. 'I will detail a pilot to\\ngo with you, and he shall be on board at twelve o'clock.'\\n\\n'But if I discharge S----, he will come on me for the whole season's\\nwages.'\\n\\n'Of course that is a matter between you and Mr. S----, captain. We\\ncannot meddle in your private affairs.'\\n\\nThe captain stormed, but to no purpose. In the end he had to discharge\\nS----, pay him about a thousand dollars, and take an association pilot\\nin his place. The laugh was beginning to turn the other way now. Every\\nday, thenceforward, a new victim fell; every day some outraged captain\\ndischarged a non-association pet, with tears and profanity, and\\ninstalled a hated association man in his berth. In a very little while,\\nidle non-associationists began to be pretty plenty, brisk as business\\nwas, and much as their services were desired. The laugh was shifting to\\nthe other side of their mouths most palpably. These victims, together\\nwith the captains and owners, presently ceased to laugh altogether,\\nand began to rage about the revenge they would take when the passing\\nbusiness 'spurt' was over.\\n\\nSoon all the laughers that were left were the owners and crews of boats\\nthat had two non-association pilots. But their triumph was not very\\nlong-lived. For this reason: It was a rigid rule of the association\\nthat its members should never, under any circumstances whatever, give\\ninformation about the channel to any 'outsider.' By this time about half\\nthe boats had none but association pilots, and the other half had none\\nbut outsiders. At the first glance one would suppose that when it came\\nto forbidding information about the river these two parties could play\\nequally at that game; but this was not so. At every good-sized town from\\none end of the river to the other, there was a 'wharf-boat' to land\\nat, instead of a wharf or a pier. Freight was stored in it for\\ntransportation; waiting passengers slept in its cabins. Upon each\\nof these wharf-boats the association's officers placed a strong box\\nfastened with a peculiar lock which was used in no other service but\\none--the United States mail service. It was the letter-bag lock, a\\nsacred governmental thing. By dint of much beseeching the government\\nhad been persuaded to allow the association to use this lock. Every\\nassociation man carried a key which would open these boxes. That key, or\\nrather a peculiar way of holding it in the hand when its owner was asked\\nfor river information by a stranger--for the success of the St. Louis\\nand New Orleans association had now bred tolerably thriving branches in\\na dozen neighboring steamboat trades--was the association man's sign and\\ndiploma of membership; and if the stranger did not respond by producing\\na similar key and holding it in a certain manner duly prescribed, his\\nquestion was politely ignored.\\n\\nFrom the association's secretary each member received a package of more\\nor less gorgeous blanks, printed like a billhead, on handsome paper,\\nproperly ruled in columns; a bill-head worded something like this--\\n\\nThese blanks were filled up, day by day, as the voyage progressed, and\\ndeposited in the several wharf-boat boxes. For instance, as soon as the\\nfirst crossing, out from St. Louis, was completed, the items would be\\nentered upon the blank, under the appropriate headings, thus--\\n\\n'St. Louis. Nine and a half (feet). Stern on court-house, head on dead\\ncottonwood above wood-yard, until you raise the first reef, then pull up\\nsquare.' Then under head of Remarks: 'Go just outside the wrecks; this\\nis important. New snag just where you straighten down; go above it.'\\n\\nThe pilot who deposited that blank in the Cairo box (after adding to it\\nthe details of every crossing all the way down from St. Louis) took\\nout and read half a dozen fresh reports (from upward-bound steamers)\\nconcerning the river between Cairo and Memphis, posted himself\\nthoroughly, returned them to the box, and went back aboard his boat\\nagain so armed against accident that he could not possibly get his boat\\ninto trouble without bringing the most ingenious carelessness to his\\naid.\\n\\nImagine the benefits of so admirable a system in a piece of river twelve\\nor thirteen hundred miles long, whose channel was shifting every day!\\nThe pilot who had formerly been obliged to put up with seeing a shoal\\nplace once or possibly twice a month, had a hundred sharp eyes to watch\\nit for him, now, and bushels of intelligent brains to tell him how to\\nrun it. His information about it was seldom twenty-four hours old. If\\nthe reports in the last box chanced to leave any misgivings on his\\nmind concerning a treacherous crossing, he had his remedy; he blew his\\nsteam-whistle in a peculiar way as soon as he saw a boat approaching;\\nthe signal was answered in a peculiar way if that boat's pilots were\\nassociation men; and then the two steamers ranged alongside and all\\nuncertainties were swept away by fresh information furnished to the\\ninquirer by word of mouth and in minute detail.\\n\\nThe first thing a pilot did when he reached New Orleans or St. Louis was\\nto take his final and elaborate report to the association parlors and\\nhang it up there,--after which he was free to visit his family. In these\\nparlors a crowd was always gathered together, discussing changes in the\\nchannel, and the moment there was a fresh arrival, everybody stopped\\ntalking till this witness had told the newest news and settled the\\nlatest uncertainty. Other craftsmen can 'sink the shop,' sometimes,\\nand interest themselves in other matters. Not so with a pilot; he must\\ndevote himself wholly to his profession and talk of nothing else; for it\\nwould be small gain to be perfect one day and imperfect the next. He has\\nno time or words to waste if he would keep 'posted.'\\n\\nBut the outsiders had a hard time of it. No particular place to meet\\nand exchange information, no wharf-boat reports, none but chance and\\nunsatisfactory ways of getting news. The consequence was that a man\\nsometimes had to run five hundred miles of river on information that\\nwas a week or ten days old. At a fair stage of the river that might have\\nanswered; but when the dead low water came it was destructive.\\n\\nNow came another perfectly logical result. The outsiders began to\\nground steamboats, sink them, and get into all sorts of trouble,\\nwhereas accidents seemed to keep entirely away from the association men.\\nWherefore even the owners and captains of boats furnished exclusively\\nwith outsiders, and previously considered to be wholly independent of\\nthe association and free to comfort themselves with brag and laughter,\\nbegan to feel pretty uncomfortable. Still, they made a show of keeping\\nup the brag, until one black day when every captain of the lot was\\nformally ordered to immediately discharge his outsiders and take\\nassociation pilots in their stead. And who was it that had the dashing\\npresumption to do that? Alas, it came from a power behind the throne\\nthat was greater than the throne itself. It was the underwriters!\\n\\nIt was no time to 'swap knives.' Every outsider had to take his trunk\\nashore at once. Of course it was supposed that there was collusion\\nbetween the association and the underwriters, but this was not so. The\\nlatter had come to comprehend the excellence of the 'report' system of\\nthe association and the safety it secured, and so they had made their\\ndecision among themselves and upon plain business principles.\\n\\nThere was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp of\\nthe outsiders now. But no matter, there was but one course for them to\\npursue, and they pursued it. They came forward in couples and groups,\\nand proffered their twelve dollars and asked for membership. They were\\nsurprised to learn that several new by-laws had been long ago added. For\\ninstance, the initiation fee had been raised to fifty dollars; that\\nsum must be tendered, and also ten per cent. of the wages which the\\napplicant had received each and every month since the founding of\\nthe association. In many cases this amounted to three or four hundred\\ndollars. Still, the association would not entertain the application\\nuntil the money was present. Even then a single adverse vote killed the\\napplication. Every member had to vote 'Yes' or 'No' in person and before\\nwitnesses; so it took weeks to decide a candidacy, because many pilots\\nwere so long absent on voyages. However, the repentant sinners scraped\\ntheir savings together, and one by one, by our tedious voting process,\\nthey were added to the fold. A time came, at last, when only about ten\\nremained outside. They said they would starve before they would apply.\\nThey remained idle a long while, because of course nobody could venture\\nto employ them.\\n\\nBy and by the association published the fact that upon a certain date\\nthe wages would be raised to five hundred dollars per month. All the\\nbranch associations had grown strong, now, and the Red River one had\\nadvanced wages to seven hundred dollars a month. Reluctantly the ten\\noutsiders yielded, in view of these things, and made application. There\\nwas another new by-law, by this time, which required them to pay dues\\nnot only on all the wages they had received since the association was\\nborn, but also on what they would have received if they had continued at\\nwork up to the time of their application, instead of going off to pout\\nin idleness. It turned out to be a difficult matter to elect them, but\\nit was accomplished at last. The most virulent sinner of this batch had\\nstayed out and allowed 'dues' to accumulate against him so long that he\\nhad to send in six hundred and twenty-five dollars with his application.\\n\\nThe association had a good bank account now, and was very strong. There\\nwas no longer an outsider. A by-law was added forbidding the reception\\nof any more cubs or apprentices for five years; after which time\\na limited number would be taken, not by individuals, but by the\\nassociation, upon these terms: the applicant must not be less than\\neighteen years old, and of respectable family and good character; he\\nmust pass an examination as to education, pay a thousand dollars in\\nadvance for the privilege of becoming an apprentice, and must remain\\nunder the commands of the association until a great part of the\\nmembership (more than half, I think) should be willing to sign his\\napplication for a pilot's license.\\n\\nAll previously-articled apprentices were now taken away from their\\nmasters and adopted by the association. The president and secretary\\ndetailed them for service on one boat or another, as they chose, and\\nchanged them from boat to boat according to certain rules. If a pilot\\ncould show that he was in infirm health and needed assistance, one of\\nthe cubs would be ordered to go with him.\\n\\nThe widow and orphan list grew, but so did the association's financial\\nresources. The association attended its own funerals in state, and paid\\nfor them. When occasion demanded, it sent members down the river upon\\nsearches for the bodies of brethren lost by steamboat accidents; a\\nsearch of this kind sometimes cost a thousand dollars.\\n\\nThe association procured a charter and went into the insurance business,\\nalso. It not only insured the lives of its members, but took risks on\\nsteamboats.\\n\\nThe organization seemed indestructible. It was the tightest monopoly in\\nthe world. By the United States law, no man could become a pilot unless\\ntwo duly licensed pilots signed his application; and now there was\\nnobody outside of the association competent to sign. Consequently the\\nmaking of pilots was at an end. Every year some would die and others\\nbecome incapacitated by age and infirmity; there would be no new ones\\nto take their places. In time, the association could put wages up to any\\nfigure it chose; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry\\nthe thing too far and provoke the national government into amending the\\nlicensing system, steamboat owners would have to submit, since there\\nwould be no help for it.\\n\\nThe owners and captains were the only obstruction that lay between\\nthe association and absolute power; and at last this one was removed.\\nIncredible as it may seem, the owners and captains deliberately did it\\nthemselves. When the pilots' association announced, months beforehand,\\nthat on the first day of September, 1861, wages would be advanced to\\nfive hundred dollars per month, the owners and captains instantly put\\nfreights up a few cents, and explained to the farmers along the river\\nthe necessity of it, by calling their attention to the burdensome rate\\nof wages about to be established. It was a rather slender argument, but\\nthe farmers did not seem to detect it. It looked reasonable to them that\\nto add five cents freight on a bushel of corn was justifiable under\\nthe circumstances, overlooking the fact that this advance on a cargo of\\nforty thousand sacks was a good deal more than necessary to cover the\\nnew wages.\\n\\nSo, straightway the captains and owners got up an association of their\\nown, and proposed to put captains' wages up to five hundred dollars,\\ntoo, and move for another advance in freights. It was a novel idea,\\nbut of course an effect which had been produced once could be produced\\nagain. The new association decreed (for this was before all the\\noutsiders had been taken into the pilots' association) that if any\\ncaptain employed a non-association pilot, he should be forced to\\ndischarge him, and also pay a fine of five hundred dollars. Several\\nof these heavy fines were paid before the captains' organization grew\\nstrong enough to exercise full authority over its membership; but that\\nall ceased, presently. The captains tried to get the pilots to decree\\nthat no member of their corporation should serve under a non-association\\ncaptain; but this proposition was declined. The pilots saw that they\\nwould be backed up by the captains and the underwriters anyhow, and so\\nthey wisely refrained from entering into entangling alliances.\\n\\nAs I have remarked, the pilots' association was now the compactest\\nmonopoly in the world, perhaps, and seemed simply indestructible.\\nAnd yet the days of its glory were numbered. First, the new railroad\\nstretching up through Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to Northern\\nrailway centers, began to divert the passenger travel from the steamers;\\nnext the war came and almost entirely annihilated the steamboating\\nindustry during several years, leaving most of the pilots idle, and the\\ncost of living advancing all the time; then the treasurer of the St.\\nLouis association put his hand into the till and walked off with\\nevery dollar of the ample fund; and finally, the railroads intruding\\neverywhere, there was little for steamers to do, when the war was over,\\nbut carry freights; so straightway some genius from the Atlantic coast\\nintroduced the plan of towing a dozen steamer cargoes down to New\\nOrleans at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat; and behold, in the\\ntwinkling of an eye, as it were, the association and the noble science\\nof piloting were things of the dead and pathetic past!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 16\\n\\nRacing Days\\n\\nIT was always the custom for the boats to leave New Orleans between four\\nand five o'clock in the afternoon. From three o'clock onward they would\\nbe burning rosin and pitch pine (the sign of preparation), and so one\\nhad the picturesque spectacle of a rank, some two or three miles long,\\nof tall, ascending columns of coal-black smoke; a colonnade which\\nsupported a sable roof of the same smoke blended together and spreading\\nabroad over the city. Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at\\nthe jack-staff, and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern.\\nTwo or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with more than\\nusual emphasis; countless processions of freight barrels and boxes were\\nspinning athwart the levee and flying aboard the stage-planks, belated\\npassengers were dodging and skipping among these frantic things, hoping\\nto reach the forecastle companion way alive, but having their doubts\\nabout it; women with reticules and bandboxes were trying to keep up with\\nhusbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies, and making a\\nfailure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and roar and general\\ndistraction; drays and baggage-vans were clattering hither and thither\\nin a wild hurry, every now and then getting blocked and jammed together,\\nand then during ten seconds one could not see them for the profanity,\\nexcept vaguely and dimly; every windlass connected with every forehatch,\\nfrom one end of that long array of steamboats to the other, was keeping\\nup a deafening whiz and whir, lowering freight into the hold, and the\\nhalf-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked them were roaring\\nsuch songs as 'De Las' Sack! De Las' Sack!'--inspired to unimaginable\\nexaltation by the chaos of turmoil and racket that was driving everybody\\nelse mad.\\n\\nBy this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers would be\\npacked and black with passengers. The 'last bells' would begin to clang,\\nall down the line, and then the powwow seemed to double; in a moment or\\ntwo the final warning came,--a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs, with\\nthe cry, 'All dat ain't goin', please to git asho'!'--and behold, the\\npowwow quadrupled! People came swarming ashore, overturning excited\\nstragglers that were trying to swarm aboard. One more moment later a\\nlong array of stage-planks was being hauled in, each with its customary\\nlatest passenger clinging to the end of it with teeth, nails, and\\neverything else, and the customary latest procrastinator making a wild\\nspring shoreward over his head.\\n\\nNow a number of the boats slide backward into the stream, leaving wide\\ngaps in the serried rank of steamers. Citizens crowd the decks of boats\\nthat are not to go, in order to see the sight. Steamer after steamer\\nstraightens herself up, gathers all her strength, and presently comes\\nswinging by, under a tremendous head of steam, with flag flying, black\\nsmoke rolling, and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands (usually\\nswarthy negroes) massed together on the forecastle, the best 'voice' in\\nthe lot towering from the midst (being mounted on the capstan), waving\\nhis hat or a flag, and all roaring a mighty chorus, while the parting\\ncannons boom and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and\\nhuzza! Steamer after steamer falls into line, and the stately procession\\ngoes winging its flight up the river.\\n\\nIn the old times, whenever two fast boats started out on a race, with a\\nbig crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring to hear the crews sing,\\nespecially if the time were night-fall, and the forecastle lit up with\\nthe red glare of the torch-baskets. Racing was royal fun. The public\\nalways had an idea that racing was dangerous; whereas the opposite was\\nthe case--that is, after the laws were passed which restricted each boat\\nto just so many pounds of steam to the square inch. No engineer was ever\\nsleepy or careless when his heart was in a race. He was constantly on\\nthe alert, trying gauge-cocks and watching things. The dangerous place\\nwas on slow, plodding boats, where the engineers drowsed around and\\nallowed chips to get into the 'doctor' and shut off the water supply\\nfrom the boilers.\\n\\nIn the 'flush times' of steamboating, a race between two notoriously\\nfleet steamers was an event of vast importance. The date was set for\\nit several weeks in advance, and from that time forward, the whole\\nMississippi Valley was in a state of consuming excitement. Politics and\\nthe weather were dropped, and people talked only of the coming race. As\\nthe time approached, the two steamers 'stripped' and got ready. Every\\nencumbrance that added weight, or exposed a resisting surface to wind\\nor water, was removed, if the boat could possibly do without it. The\\n'spars,' and sometimes even their supporting derricks, were sent ashore,\\nand no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground. When\\nthe 'Eclipse' and the 'A. L. Shotwell' ran their great race many years\\nago, it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the\\nfanciful device which hung between the 'Eclipse's' chimneys, and that\\nfor that one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and had his head\\nshaved. But I always doubted these things.\\n\\nIf the boat was known to make her best speed when drawing five and a\\nhalf feet forward and five feet aft, she was carefully loaded to that\\nexact figure--she wouldn't enter a dose of homoeopathic pills on her\\nmanifest after that. Hardly any passengers were taken, because they not\\nonly add weight but they never will 'trim boat.' They always run to\\nthe side when there is anything to see, whereas a conscientious and\\nexperienced steamboatman would stick to the center of the boat and part\\nhis hair in the middle with a spirit level.\\n\\nNo way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed, for the racers would\\nstop only at the largest towns, and then it would be only 'touch and\\ngo.' Coal flats and wood flats were contracted for beforehand, and\\nthese were kept ready to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment's\\nwarning. Double crews were carried, so that all work could be quickly\\ndone.\\n\\nThe chosen date being come, and all things in readiness, the two great\\nsteamers back into the stream, and lie there jockeying a moment, and\\napparently watching each other's slightest movement, like sentient\\ncreatures; flags drooping, the pent steam shrieking through\\nsafety-valves, the black smoke rolling and tumbling from the chimneys\\nand darkening all the air. People, people everywhere; the shores, the\\nhouse-tops, the steamboats, the ships, are packed with them, and you\\nknow that the borders of the broad Mississippi are going to be fringed\\nwith humanity thence northward twelve hundred miles, to welcome these\\nracers.\\n\\nPresently tall columns of steam burst from the 'scape-pipes of both\\nsteamers, two guns boom a good-bye, two red-shirted heroes mounted\\non capstans wave their small flags above the massed crews on the\\nforecastles, two plaintive solos linger on the air a few waiting\\nseconds, two mighty choruses burst forth--and here they come! Brass\\nbands bray Hail Columbia, huzza after huzza thunders from the shores,\\nand the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind.\\n\\nThose boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and St. Louis,\\nexcept for a second or two at large towns, or to hitch thirty-cord\\nwood-boats alongside. You should be on board when they take a couple of\\nthose wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of men into each; by the time\\nyou have wiped your glasses and put them on, you will be wondering what\\nhas become of that wood.\\n\\nTwo nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other day after\\nday. They might even stay side by side, but for the fact that pilots are\\nnot all alike, and the smartest pilots will win the race. If one of the\\nboats has a 'lightning' pilot, whose 'partner' is a trifle his inferior,\\nyou can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has\\ngained ground or lost some during each four-hour stretch. The shrewdest\\npilot can delay a boat if he has not a fine genius for steering.\\nSteering is a very high art. One must not keep a rudder dragging across\\na boat's stem if he wants to get up the river fast.\\n\\nThere is a great difference in boats, of course. For a long time I was\\non a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left\\nport in. But of course this was at rare intervals. Ferryboats used to\\nlose valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died, waiting\\nfor us to get by. This was at still rarer intervals. I had the documents\\nfor these occurrences, but through carelessness they have been mislaid.\\nThis boat, the 'John J. Roe,' was so slow that when she finally sunk in\\nMadrid Bend, it was five years before the owners heard of it. That was\\nalways a confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record, any\\nway. She was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting times\\nracing with islands, and rafts, and such things. One trip, however, we\\ndid rather well. We went to St. Louis in sixteen days. But even at\\nthis rattling gait I think we changed watches three times in Fort Adams\\nreach, which is five miles long. A 'reach' is a piece of straight river,\\nand of course the current drives through such a place in a pretty lively\\nway.\\n\\nThat trip we went to Grand Gulf, from New Orleans, in four days (three\\nhundred and forty miles); the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' did it in one.\\nWe were nine days out, in the chute of 63 (seven hundred miles); the\\n'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' went there in two days. Something over a\\ngeneration ago, a boat called the 'J. M. White' went from New Orleans\\nto Cairo in three days, six hours, and forty-four minutes. In 1853 the\\n'Eclipse' made the same trip in three days, three hours, and twenty\\nminutes.{footnote [Time disputed. Some authorities add 1 hour and 16\\nminutes to this.]} In 1870 the 'R. E. Lee' did it in three days and\\n_one_ hour. This last is called the fastest trip on record. I will\\ntry to show that it was not. For this reason: the distance between\\nNew Orleans and Cairo, when the 'J. M. White' ran it, was about eleven\\nhundred and six miles; consequently her average speed was a trifle over\\nfourteen miles per hour. In the 'Eclipse's' day the distance between\\nthe two ports had become reduced to one thousand and eighty miles;\\nconsequently her average speed was a shade under fourteen and\\nthree-eighths miles per hour. In the 'R. E. Lee's' time the distance\\nhad diminished to about one thousand and thirty miles; consequently her\\naverage was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour. Therefore the\\n'Eclipse's' was conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 17\\n\\nCut-offs and Stephen\\n\\nTHESE dry details are of importance in one particular. They give me\\nan opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi's oddest\\npeculiarities,--that of shortening its length from time to time. If\\nyou will throw a long, pliant apple-paring over your shoulder, it will\\npretty fairly shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi\\nRiver; that is, the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo,\\nIllinois, southward to New Orleans, the same being wonderfully crooked,\\nwith a brief straight bit here and there at wide intervals. The two\\nhundred-mile stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no means so\\ncrooked, that being a rocky country which the river cannot cut much.\\n\\nThe water cuts the alluvial banks of the 'lower' river into deep\\nhorseshoe curves; so deep, indeed, that in some places if you were to\\nget ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck,\\nhalf or three quarters of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple\\nof hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at a speed\\nof ten miles an hour, to take you aboard again. When the river is\\nrising fast, some scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country, and\\ntherefore of inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little\\ngutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the\\nwater into it, and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has happened:\\nto wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch,\\nand placed the countryman's plantation on its bank (quadrupling its\\nvalue), and that other party's formerly valuable plantation finds itself\\naway out yonder on a big island; the old watercourse around it will soon\\nshoal up, boats cannot approach within ten miles of it, and down goes\\nits value to a fourth of its former worth. Watches are kept on those\\nnarrow necks, at needful times, and if a man happens to be caught\\ncutting a ditch across them, the chances are all against his ever having\\nanother opportunity to cut a ditch.\\n\\nPray observe some of the effects of this ditching business. Once there\\nwas a neck opposite Port Hudson, Louisiana, which was only half a mile\\nacross, in its narrowest place. You could walk across there in fifteen\\nminutes; but if you made the journey around the cape on a raft, you\\ntraveled thirty-five miles to accomplish the same thing. In 1722 the\\nriver darted through that neck, deserted its old bed, and thus\\nshortened itself thirty-five miles. In the same way it shortened itself\\ntwenty-five miles at Black Hawk Point in 1699. Below Red River Landing,\\nRaccourci cut-off was made (forty or fifty years ago, I think). This\\nshortened the river twenty-eight miles. In our day, if you travel by\\nriver from the southernmost of these three cut-offs to the northernmost,\\nyou go only seventy miles. To do the same thing a hundred and\\nseventy-six years ago, one had to go a hundred and fifty-eight\\nmiles!--shortening of eighty-eight miles in that trifling distance.\\nAt some forgotten time in the past, cut-offs were made above Vidalia,\\nLouisiana; at island 92; at island 84; and at Hale's Point. These\\nshortened the river, in the aggregate, seventy-seven miles.\\n\\nSince my own day on the Mississippi, cut-offs have been made at\\nHurricane Island; at island 100; at Napoleon, Arkansas; at Walnut\\nBend; and at Council Bend. These shortened the river, in the aggregate,\\nsixty-seven miles. In my own time a cut-off was made at American Bend,\\nwhich shortened the river ten miles or more.\\n\\nTherefore, the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve\\nhundred and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy-six years ago.\\nIt was eleven hundred and eighty after the cut-off of 1722. It was\\none thousand and forty after the American Bend cut-off. It has lost\\nsixty-seven miles since. Consequently its length is only nine hundred\\nand seventy-three miles at present.\\n\\nNow, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people, and\\n'let on' to prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had\\noccurred in a given time in the recent past, or what will occur in the\\nfar future by what has occurred in late years, what an opportunity is\\nhere! Geology never had such a chance, nor such exact data to argue\\nfrom! Nor 'development of species,' either! Glacial epochs are great\\nthings, but they are vague--vague. Please observe:--\\n\\nIn the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi\\nhas shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That is an average\\nof a trifle over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm\\nperson, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that in the Old Oolitic\\nSilurian Period,' just a million years ago next November, the Lower\\nMississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand\\nmiles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod.\\nAnd by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and\\nforty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and\\nthree-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their\\nstreets together, and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor\\nand a mutual board of aldermen. There is something fascinating about\\nscience. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a\\ntrifling investment of fact.\\n\\nWhen the water begins to flow through one of those ditches I have been\\nspeaking of, it is time for the people thereabouts to move. The water\\ncleaves the banks away like a knife. By the time the ditch has become\\ntwelve or fifteen feet wide, the calamity is as good as accomplished,\\nfor no power on earth can stop it now. When the width has reached a\\nhundred yards, the banks begin to peel off in slices half an acre wide.\\nThe current flowing around the bend traveled formerly only five miles\\nan hour; now it is tremendously increased by the shortening of the\\ndistance. I was on board the first boat that tried to go through the\\ncut-off at American Bend, but we did not get through. It was toward\\nmidnight, and a wild night it was--thunder, lightning, and torrents of\\nrain. It was estimated that the current in the cut-off was making about\\nfifteen or twenty miles an hour; twelve or thirteen was the best our\\nboat could do, even in tolerably slack water, therefore perhaps we were\\nfoolish to try the cut-off. However, Mr. Brown was ambitious, and he\\nkept on trying. The eddy running up the bank, under the 'point,' was\\nabout as swift as the current out in the middle; so we would go flying\\nup the shore like a lightning express train, get on a big head of steam,\\nand 'stand by for a surge' when we struck the current that was whirling\\nby the point. But all our preparations were useless. The instant the\\ncurrent hit us it spun us around like a top, the water deluged the\\nforecastle, and the boat careened so far over that one could hardly keep\\nhis feet. The next instant we were away down the river, clawing with\\nmight and main to keep out of the woods. We tried the experiment\\nfour times. I stood on the forecastle companion way to see. It was\\nastonishing to observe how suddenly the boat would spin around and turn\\ntail the moment she emerged from the eddy and the current struck her\\nnose. The sounding concussion and the quivering would have been about\\nthe same if she had come full speed against a sand-bank. Under the\\nlightning flashes one could see the plantation cabins and the goodly\\nacres tumble into the river; and the crash they made was not a bad\\neffort at thunder. Once, when we spun around, we only missed a house\\nabout twenty feet, that had a light burning in the window; and in\\nthe same instant that house went overboard. Nobody could stay on our\\nforecastle; the water swept across it in a torrent every time we plunged\\nathwart the current. At the end of our fourth effort we brought up\\nin the woods two miles below the cut-off; all the country there was\\noverflowed, of course. A day or two later the cut-off was three-quarters\\nof a mile wide, and boats passed up through it without much difficulty,\\nand so saved ten miles.\\n\\nThe old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river's length twenty-eight miles.\\nThere used to be a tradition connected with it. It was said that a boat\\ncame along there in the night and went around the enormous elbow the\\nusual way, the pilots not knowing that the cut-off had been made. It was\\na grisly, hideous night, and all shapes were vague and distorted. The\\nold bend had already begun to fill up, and the boat got to running\\naway from mysterious reefs, and occasionally hitting one. The perplexed\\npilots fell to swearing, and finally uttered the entirely unnecessary\\nwish that they might never get out of that place. As always happens\\nin such cases, that particular prayer was answered, and the others\\nneglected. So to this day that phantom steamer is still butting around\\nin that deserted river, trying to find her way out. More than one grave\\nwatchman has sworn to me that on drizzly, dismal nights, he has glanced\\nfearfully down that forgotten river as he passed the head of the island,\\nand seen the faint glow of the specter steamer's lights drifting through\\nthe distant gloom, and heard the muffled cough of her 'scape-pipes and\\nthe plaintive cry of her leadsmen.\\n\\nIn the absence of further statistics, I beg to close this chapter with\\none more reminiscence of 'Stephen.'\\n\\nMost of the captains and pilots held Stephen's note for borrowed sums,\\nranging from two hundred and fifty dollars upward. Stephen never paid\\none of these notes, but he was very prompt and very zealous about\\nrenewing them every twelve months.\\n\\nOf course there came a time, at last, when Stephen could no longer\\nborrow of his ancient creditors; so he was obliged to lie in wait for\\nnew men who did not know him. Such a victim was good-hearted, simple\\nnatured young Yates (I use a fictitious name, but the real name began,\\nas this one does, with a Y). Young Yates graduated as a pilot, got a\\nberth, and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk's\\noffice and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new\\nbills, Stephen was there! His silvery tongue began to wag, and in a very\\nlittle while Yates's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands.\\nThe fact was soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement and\\nsatisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous. But innocent\\nYates never suspected that Stephen's promise to pay promptly at the\\nend of the week was a worthless one. Yates called for his money at the\\nstipulated time; Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week. He\\ncalled then, according to agreement, and came away sugar-coated again,\\nbut suffering under another postponement. So the thing went on. Yates\\nhaunted Stephen week after week, to no purpose, and at last gave it\\nup. And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates\\nappeared, there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there, but\\nbeaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to\\npay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw him coming, he would turn and\\nfly, and drag his company with him, if he had company; but it was of\\nno use; his debtor would run him down and corner him. Panting and\\nred-faced, Stephen would come, with outstretched hands and eager eyes,\\ninvade the conversation, shake both of Yates's arms loose in their\\nsockets, and begin--\\n\\n'My, what a race I've had! I saw you didn't see me, and so I clapped on\\nall steam for fear I'd miss you entirely. And here you are! there, just\\nstand so, and let me look at you! just the same old noble countenance.'\\n[To Yates's friend:] 'Just look at him! _Look _at him! Ain't it just\\n_good _to look at him! _ain't_ it now? Ain't he just a picture! _Some\\n_call him a picture; I call him a panorama! That's what he is--an entire\\npanorama. And now I'm reminded! How I do wish I could have seen you an\\nhour earlier! For twenty-four hours I've been saving up that two hundred\\nand fifty dollars for you; been looking for you everywhere. I waited at\\nthe Planter's from six yesterday evening till two o'clock this morning,\\nwithout rest or food; my wife says, “Where have you been all night?”\\n I said, “This debt lies heavy on my mind.” She says, “In all my days I\\nnever saw a man take a debt to heart the way you do.” I said, “It's my\\nnature; how can I change it?” She says, “Well, do go to bed and get some\\nrest.” I said, “Not till that poor, noble young man has got his money.”\\n So I set up all night, and this morning out I shot, and the first man\\nI struck told me you had shipped on the “Grand Turk” and gone to New\\nOrleans. Well, sir, I had to lean up against a building and cry. So help\\nme goodness, I couldn't help it. The man that owned the place come\\nout cleaning up with a rag, and said he didn't like to have people cry\\nagainst his building, and then it seemed to me that the whole world had\\nturned against me, and it wasn't any use to live any more; and coming\\nalong an hour ago, suffering no man knows what agony, I met Jim Wilson\\nand paid him the two hundred and fifty dollars on account; and to think\\nthat here you are, now, and I haven't got a cent! But as sure as I am\\nstanding here on this ground on this particular brick,--there, I've\\nscratched a mark on the brick to remember it by,--I'll borrow that money\\nand pay it over to you at twelve o'clock sharp, tomorrow! Now, stand so;\\nlet me look at you just once more.'\\n\\nAnd so on. Yates's life became a burden to him. He could not escape his\\ndebtor and his debtor's awful sufferings on account of not being able\\nto pay. He dreaded to show himself in the street, lest he should find\\nStephen lying in wait for him at the corner.\\n\\nBogart's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in those days.\\nThey met there about as much to exchange river news as to play. One\\nmorning Yates was there; Stephen was there, too, but kept out of sight.\\nBut by and by, when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town,\\nStephen suddenly appeared in the midst, and rushed for Yates as for a\\nlong-lost brother.\\n\\n'_Oh_, I am so glad to see you! Oh my soul, the sight of you is such a\\ncomfort to my eyes! Gentlemen, I owe all of you money; among you I owe\\nprobably forty thousand dollars. I want to pay it; I intend to pay it\\nevery last cent of it. You all know, without my telling you, what sorrow\\nit has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such\\npatient and generous friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer--by far\\nthe sharpest--is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here; and I\\nhave come to this place this morning especially to make the announcement\\nthat I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my debts!\\nAnd most especially I wanted _him _to be here when I announced it. Yes,\\nmy faithful friend,--my benefactor, I've found the method! I've found\\nthe method to pay off all my debts, and you'll get your money!' Hope\\ndawned in Yates's eye; then Stephen, beaming benignantly, and placing\\nhis hand upon Yates's head, added, 'I am going to pay them off in\\nalphabetical order!'\\n\\nThen he turned and disappeared. The full significance of Stephen's\\n'method' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing crowd for some two\\nminutes; and then Yates murmured with a sigh--\\n\\n'Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance. He won't get any further than the\\nC's in _this _world, and I reckon that after a good deal of eternity has\\nwasted away in the next one, I'll still be referred to up there as “that\\npoor, ragged pilot that came here from St. Louis in the early days!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18\\n\\nI Take a Few Extra Lessons\\n\\nDURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship, I served\\nunder many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and\\nmany varieties of steamboats; for it was not always convenient for Mr.\\nBixby to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with somebody\\nelse. I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience; for in\\nthat brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarly acquainted\\nwith about all the different types of human nature that are to be found\\nin fiction, biography, or history. The fact is daily borne in upon me,\\nthat the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years\\nto equip a man with this sort of an education. When I say I am still\\nprofiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me a\\njudge of men--no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not\\nmade. My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it\\nwhich I value most is the zest which that early experience has given\\nto my later reading. When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or\\nbiography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the\\nreason that I have known him before--met him on the river.\\n\\nThe figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows of that\\nvanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer 'Pennsylvania'--the man\\nreferred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and tiresome.\\nHe was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced,\\nignorant, stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying\\ntyrant. I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart.\\nNo matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch\\nbelow, and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft,\\nmy soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house.\\n\\nI still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man.\\nThe boat had backed out from St. Louis and was 'straightening down;'\\nI ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proud to be\\nsemi-officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous\\na boat. Brown was at the wheel. I paused in the middle of the room, all\\nfixed to make my bow, but Brown did not look around. I thought he took a\\nfurtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye, but as not even this\\nnotice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken. By this time he was\\npicking his way among some dangerous 'breaks' abreast the woodyards;\\ntherefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so I stepped softly\\nto the high bench and took a seat.\\n\\nThere was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turned and inspected\\nme deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for about--as\\nit seemed to me--a quarter of an hour. After which he removed his\\ncountenance and I saw it no more for some seconds; then it came around\\nonce more, and this question greeted me--\\n\\n'Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\nAfter this there was a pause and another inspection. Then--\\n\\n'What's your name?'\\n\\nI told him. He repeated it after me. It was probably the only thing he\\never forgot; for although I was with him many months he never addressed\\nhimself to me in any other way than 'Here!' and then his command\\nfollowed.\\n\\n'Where was you born?'\\n\\n'In Florida, Missouri.'\\n\\nA pause. Then--\\n\\n'Dern sight better staid there!'\\n\\nBy means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumped my\\nfamily history out of me.\\n\\nThe leads were going now, in the first crossing. This interrupted the\\ninquest. When the leads had been laid in, he resumed--\\n\\n'How long you been on the river?'\\n\\nI told him. After a pause--\\n\\n'Where'd you get them shoes?'\\n\\nI gave him the information.\\n\\n'Hold up your foot!'\\n\\nI did so. He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and\\ncontemptuously, scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his\\nhigh sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation, then\\nejaculated, 'Well, I'll be dod derned!' and returned to his wheel.\\n\\nWhat occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is\\nstill as much of a mystery to me now as it was then. It must have\\nbeen all of fifteen minutes--fifteen minutes of dull, homesick\\nsilence--before that long horse-face swung round upon me again--and\\nthen, what a change! It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was\\nworking. Now came this shriek--\\n\\n'Here!--You going to set there all day?'\\n\\nI lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electric\\nsuddenness of the surprise. As soon as I could get my voice I said,\\napologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.'\\n\\n'You've had no _orders_! My, what a fine bird we are! We must have\\n_orders_! Our father was a _gentleman_--owned slaves--and we've been\\nto _school_. Yes, _we _are a gentleman, _too_, and got to have _orders!\\norders_, is it? _Orders _is what you want! Dod dern my skin, _i'll_\\nlearn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about your\\ndod-derned _orders_! G'way from the wheel!' (I had approached it without\\nknowing it.)\\n\\nI moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my senses\\nstupefied by this frantic assault.\\n\\n'What you standing there for? Take that ice-pitcher down to the\\ntexas-tender-come, move along, and don't you be all day about it!'\\n\\nThe moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said--\\n\\n'Here! What was you doing down there all this time?'\\n\\n'I couldn't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to the\\npantry.'\\n\\n'Derned likely story! Fill up the stove.'\\n\\nI proceeded to do so. He watched me like a cat. Presently he shouted--\\n\\n'Put down that shovel! Deadest numskull I ever saw--ain't even got sense\\nenough to load up a stove.'\\n\\nAll through the watch this sort of thing went on. Yes, and the\\nsubsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months. As I\\nhave said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread. The moment\\nI was in the presence, even in the darkest night, I could feel those\\nyellow eyes upon me, and knew their owner was watching for a pretext to\\nspit out some venom on me. Preliminarily he would say--\\n\\n'Here! Take the wheel.'\\n\\nTwo minutes later--\\n\\n'_Where _in the nation you going to? Pull her down! pull her down!'\\n\\nAfter another moment--\\n\\n'Say! You going to hold her all day? Let her go--meet her! meet her!'\\n\\nThen he would jump from the bench, snatch the wheel from me, and meet\\nher himself, pouring out wrath upon me all the time.\\n\\nGeorge Ritchie was the other pilot's cub. He was having good times now;\\nfor his boss, George Ealer, was as kindhearted as Brown wasn't. Ritchie\\nhad steeled for Brown the season before; consequently he knew exactly\\nhow to entertain himself and plague me, all by the one operation.\\nWhenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer's watch, Ritchie would\\nsit back on the bench and play Brown, with continual ejaculations of\\n'Snatch her! snatch her! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!' 'Here! Where you\\ngoing _now_? Going to run over that snag?' 'Pull her _down_! Don't you\\nhear me? Pull her _down!_' 'There she goes! _Just _as I expected! I\\n_told_ you not to cramp that reef. G'way from the wheel!'\\n\\nSo I always had a rough time of it, no matter whose watch it was; and\\nsometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie's good-natured badgering was\\npretty nearly as aggravating as Brown's dead-earnest nagging.\\n\\nI often wanted to kill Brown, but this would not answer. A cub had\\nto take everything his boss gave, in the way of vigorous comment and\\ncriticism; and we all believed that there was a United States law making\\nit a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on\\nduty. However, I could _imagine _myself killing Brown; there was no law\\nagainst that; and that was the thing I used always to do the moment I\\nwas abed. Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty,\\nI threw business aside for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown\\nevery night for months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in new\\nand picturesque ones;--ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness\\nof design and ghastliness of situation and environment.\\n\\nBrown was _always _watching for a pretext to find fault; and if he could\\nfind no plausible pretext, he would invent one. He would scold you for\\nshaving a shore, and for not shaving it; for hugging a bar, and for not\\nhugging it; for 'pulling down' when not invited, and for not pulling\\ndown when not invited; for firing up without orders, and for waiting\\n_for_ orders. In a word, it was his invariable rule to find fault with\\n_everything _you did; and another invariable rule of his was to throw\\nall his remarks (to you) into the form of an insult.\\n\\nOne day we were approaching New Madrid, bound down and heavily laden.\\nBrown was at one side of the wheel, steering; I was at the other,\\nstanding by to 'pull down' or 'shove up.' He cast a furtive glance at me\\nevery now and then. I had long ago learned what that meant; viz., he was\\ntrying to invent a trap for me. I wondered what shape it was going to\\ntake. By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual\\nsnarly way--\\n\\n'Here!--See if you've got gumption enough to round her to.'\\n\\nThis was simply _bound _to be a success; nothing could prevent it; for\\nhe had never allowed me to round the boat to before; consequently, no\\nmatter how I might do the thing, he could find free fault with it. He\\nstood back there with his greedy eye on me, and the result was what\\nmight have been foreseen: I lost my head in a quarter of a minute, and\\ndidn't know what I was about; I started too early to bring the boat\\naround, but detected a green gleam of joy in Brown's eye, and corrected\\nmy mistake; I started around once more while too high up, but corrected\\nmyself again in time; I made other false moves, and still managed to\\nsave myself; but at last I grew so confused and anxious that I tumbled\\ninto the very worst blunder of all--I got too far down before beginning\\nto fetch the boat around. Brown's chance was come.\\n\\nHis face turned red with passion; he made one bound, hurled me across\\nthe house with a sweep of his arm, spun the wheel down, and began to\\npour out a stream of vituperation upon me which lasted till he was out\\nof breath. In the course of this speech he called me all the different\\nkinds of hard names he could think of, and once or twice I thought he\\nwas even going to swear--but he didn't this time. 'Dod dern' was the\\nnearest he ventured to the luxury of swearing, for he had been brought\\nup with a wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone.\\n\\nThat was an uncomfortable hour; for there was a big audience on the\\nhurricane deck. When I went to bed that night, I killed Brown in\\nseventeen different ways--all of them new.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19\\n\\nBrown and I Exchange Compliments\\n\\nTwo trips later, I got into serious trouble. Brown was steering; I was\\n'pulling down.' My younger brother appeared on the hurricane deck, and\\nshouted to Brown to stop at some landing or other a mile or so below.\\nBrown gave no intimation that he had heard anything. But that was his\\nway: he never condescended to take notice of an under clerk. The wind\\nwas blowing; Brown was deaf (although he always pretended he wasn't),\\nand I very much doubted if he had heard the order. If I had two heads,\\nI would have spoken; but as I had only one, it seemed judicious to take\\ncare of it; so I kept still.\\n\\nPresently, sure enough, we went sailing by that plantation. Captain\\nKlinefelter appeared on the deck, and said--\\n\\n'Let her come around, sir, let her come around. Didn't Henry tell you to\\nland here?'\\n\\n'_No_, sir!'\\n\\n'I sent him up to do, it.'\\n\\n'He did come up; and that's all the good it done, the dod-derned fool.\\nHe never said anything.'\\n\\n'Didn't _you _hear him?' asked the captain of me.\\n\\nOf course I didn't want to be mixed up in this business, but there was\\nno way to avoid it; so I said--\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\nI knew what Brown's next remark would be, before he uttered it; it was--\\n\\n'Shut your mouth! you never heard anything of the kind.'\\n\\nI closed my mouth according to instructions. An hour later, Henry\\nentered the pilot-house, unaware of what had been going on. He was a\\nthoroughly inoffensive boy, and I was sorry to see him come, for I knew\\nBrown would have no pity on him. Brown began, straightway--\\n\\n'Here! why didn't you tell me we'd got to land at that plantation?'\\n\\n'I did tell you, Mr. Brown.'\\n\\n'It's a lie!'\\n\\nI said--\\n\\n'You lie, yourself. He did tell you.'\\n\\nBrown glared at me in unaffected surprise; and for as much as a moment\\nhe was entirely speechless; then he shouted to me--\\n\\n'I'll attend to your case in half a minute!' then to Henry, 'And you\\nleave the pilot-house; out with you!'\\n\\nIt was pilot law, and must be obeyed. The boy started out, and even had\\nhis foot on the upper step outside the door, when Brown, with a sudden\\naccess of fury, picked up a ten-pound lump of coal and sprang after him;\\nbut I was between, with a heavy stool, and I hit Brown a good honest\\nblow which stretched-him out.\\n\\nI had committed the crime of crimes--I had lifted my hand against a\\npilot on duty! I supposed I was booked for the penitentiary sure, and\\ncouldn't be booked any surer if I went on and squared my long account\\nwith this person while I had the chance; consequently I stuck to him and\\npounded him with my fists a considerable time--I do not know how long,\\nthe pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was;--but\\nin the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel: a\\nvery natural solicitude, for, all this time, here was this steamboat\\ntearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody\\nat the helm! However, Eagle Bend was two miles wide at this bank-full\\nstage, and correspondingly long and deep; and the boat was steering\\nherself straight down the middle and taking no chances. Still, that was\\nonly luck--a body _might _have found her charging into the woods.\\n\\nPerceiving, at a glance, that the 'Pennsylvania' was in no danger, Brown\\ngathered up the big spy-glass, war-club fashion, and ordered me out of\\nthe pilot-house with more than Comanche bluster. But I was not afraid of\\nhim now; so, instead of going, I tarried, and criticized his grammar; I\\nreformed his ferocious speeches for him, and put them into good English,\\ncalling his attention to the advantage of pure English over the bastard\\ndialect of the Pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted.\\nHe could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere\\nvituperation, of course; but he was not equipped for this species of\\ncontroversy; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the wheel,\\nmuttering and shaking his head; and I retired to the bench. The racket\\nhad brought everybody to the hurricane deck, and I trembled when I\\nsaw the old captain looking up from the midst of the crowd. I said\\nto myself, 'Now I _am_ done for!'--For although, as a rule, he was so\\nfatherly and indulgent toward the boat's family, and so patient of minor\\nshortcomings, he could be stern enough when the fault was worth it.\\n\\nI tried to imagine what he _would _do to a cub pilot who had been guilty\\nof such a crime as mine, committed on a boat guard-deep with costly\\nfreight and alive with passengers. Our watch was nearly ended. I thought\\nI would go and hide somewhere till I got a chance to slide ashore. So\\nI slipped out of the pilot-house, and down the steps, and around to\\nthe texas door--and was in the act of gliding within, when the captain\\nconfronted me! I dropped my head, and he stood over me in silence a\\nmoment or two, then said impressively--\\n\\n'Follow me.'\\n\\nI dropped into his wake; he led the way to his parlor in the forward end\\nof the texas. We were alone, now. He closed the after door; then moved\\nslowly to the forward one and closed that. He sat down; I stood before\\nhim. He looked at me some little time, then said--\\n\\n'So you have been fighting Mr. Brown?'\\n\\nI answered meekly--\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'Do you know that that is a very serious matter?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'Are you aware that this boat was plowing down the river fully five\\nminutes with no one at the wheel?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'Did you strike him first?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'What with?'\\n\\n'A stool, sir.'\\n\\n'Hard?'\\n\\n'Middling, sir.'\\n\\n'Did it knock him down?'\\n\\n'He--he fell, sir.'\\n\\n'Did you follow it up? Did you do anything further?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'What did you do?'\\n\\n'Pounded him, sir.'\\n\\n'Pounded him?'\\n\\n'Yes, sir.'\\n\\n'Did you pound him much?--that is, severely?'\\n\\n'One might call it that, sir, maybe.'\\n\\n'I'm deuced glad of it! Hark ye, never mention that I said that. You\\nhave been guilty of a great crime; and don't you ever be guilty of it\\nagain, on this boat. _But_--lay for him ashore! Give him a good sound\\nthrashing, do you hear? I'll pay the expenses. Now go--and mind you, not\\na word of this to anybody. Clear out with you!--you've been guilty of a\\ngreat crime, you whelp!'\\n\\nI slid out, happy with the sense of a close shave and a mighty\\ndeliverance; and I heard him laughing to himself and slapping his fat\\nthighs after I had closed his door.\\n\\nWhen Brown came off watch he went straight to the captain, who was\\ntalking with some passengers on the boiler deck, and demanded that I be\\nput ashore in New Orleans--and added--\\n\\n'I'll never turn a wheel on this boat again while that cub stays.'\\n\\nThe captain said--\\n\\n'But he needn't come round when you are on watch, Mr. Brown.\\n\\n'I won't even stay on the same boat with him. One of us has got to go\\nashore.'\\n\\n'Very well,' said the captain, 'let it be yourself;' and resumed his\\ntalk with the passengers.\\n\\nDuring the brief remainder of the trip, I knew how an emancipated slave\\nfeels; for I was an emancipated slave myself. While we lay at landings,\\nI listened to George Ealer's flute; or to his readings from his two\\nbibles, that is to say, Goldsmith and Shakespeare; or I played chess\\nwith him--and would have beaten him sometimes, only he always took back\\nhis last move and ran the game out differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 20\\n\\nA Catastrophe\\n\\nWE lay three days in New Orleans, but the captain did not succeed in\\nfinding another pilot; so he proposed that I should stand a daylight\\nwatch, and leave the night watches to George Ealer. But I was afraid; I\\nhad never stood a watch of any sort by myself, and I believed I should\\nbe sure to get into trouble in the head of some chute, or ground the\\nboat in a near cut through some bar or other. Brown remained in his\\nplace; but he would not travel with me. So the captain gave me an order\\non the captain of the 'A. T. Lacey,' for a passage to St. Louis, and\\nsaid he would find a new pilot there and my steersman's berth could\\nthen be resumed. The 'Lacey' was to leave a couple of days after the\\n'Pennsylvania.'\\n\\nThe night before the '_Pennsylvania_' left, Henry and I sat chatting\\non a freight pile on the levee till midnight. The subject of the chat,\\nmainly, was one which I think we had not exploited before--steamboat\\ndisasters. One was then on its way to us, little as we suspected it;\\nthe water which was to make the steam which should cause it, was washing\\npast some point fifteen hundred miles up the river while we talked;--but\\nit would arrive at the right time and the right place. We doubted if\\npersons not clothed with authority were of much use in cases of disaster\\nand attendant panic; still, they might be of _some _use; so we decided\\nthat if a disaster ever fell within our experience we would at least\\nstick to the boat, and give such minor service as chance might throw in\\nthe way. Henry remembered this, afterward, when the disaster came, and\\nacted accordingly.\\n\\nThe 'Lacey' started up the river two days behind the 'Pennsylvania.' We\\ntouched at Greenville, Mississippi, a couple of days out, and somebody\\nshouted--\\n\\n'The “Pennsylvania” is blown up at Ship Island, and a hundred and fifty\\nlives lost!'\\n\\nAt Napoleon, Arkansas, the same evening, we got an extra, issued by a\\nMemphis paper, which gave some particulars. It mentioned my brother, and\\nsaid he was not hurt.\\n\\nFurther up the river we got a later extra. My brother was again\\nmentioned; but this time as being hurt beyond help. We did not get\\nfull details of the catastrophe until we reached Memphis. This is the\\nsorrowful story--\\n\\nIt was six o'clock on a hot summer morning. The 'Pennsylvania' was\\ncreeping along, north of Ship Island, about sixty miles below Memphis on\\na half-head of steam, towing a wood-flat which was fast being emptied.\\nGeorge Ealer was in the pilot-house-alone, I think; the second engineer\\nand a striker had the watch in the engine room; the second mate had\\nthe watch on deck; George Black, Mr. Wood, and my brother, clerks, were\\nasleep, as were also Brown and the head engineer, the carpenter, the\\nchief mate, and one striker; Captain Klinefelter was in the barber's\\nchair, and the barber was preparing to shave him. There were a good many\\ncabin passengers aboard, and three or four hundred deck passengers--so\\nit was said at the time--and not very many of them were astir. The wood\\nbeing nearly all out of the flat now, Ealer rang to 'come ahead' full\\nsteam, and the next moment four of the eight boilers exploded with a\\nthunderous crash, and the whole forward third of the boat was hoisted\\ntoward the sky! The main part of the mass, with the chimneys, dropped\\nupon the boat again, a mountain of riddled and chaotic rubbish--and\\nthen, after a little, fire broke out.\\n\\nMany people were flung to considerable distances, and fell in the\\nriver; among these were Mr. Wood and my brother, and the carpenter. The\\ncarpenter was still stretched upon his mattress when he struck the water\\nseventy-five feet from the boat. Brown, the pilot, and George Black,\\nchief clerk, were never seen or heard of after the explosion. The\\nbarber's chair, with Captain Klinefelter in it and unhurt, was left with\\nits back overhanging vacancy--everything forward of it, floor and all,\\nhad disappeared; and the stupefied barber, who was also unhurt,\\nstood with one toe projecting over space, still stirring his lather\\nunconsciously, and saying, not a word.\\n\\nWhen George Ealer saw the chimneys plunging aloft in front of him, he\\nknew what the matter was; so he muffled his face in the lapels of his\\ncoat, and pressed both hands there tightly to keep this protection in\\nits place so that no steam could get to his nose or mouth. He had ample\\ntime to attend to these details while he was going up and returning. He\\npresently landed on top of the unexploded boilers, forty feet below the\\nformer pilot-house, accompanied by his wheel and a rain of other stuff,\\nand enveloped in a cloud of scalding steam. All of the many who breathed\\nthat steam, died; none escaped. But Ealer breathed none of it. He made\\nhis way to the free air as quickly as he could; and when the steam\\ncleared away he returned and climbed up on the boilers again, and\\npatiently hunted out each and every one of his chessmen and the several\\njoints of his flute.\\n\\nBy this time the fire was beginning to threaten. Shrieks and groans\\nfilled the air. A great many persons had been scalded, a great many\\ncrippled; the explosion had driven an iron crowbar through one man's\\nbody--I think they said he was a priest. He did not die at once, and his\\nsufferings were very dreadful. A young French naval cadet, of fifteen,\\nson of a French admiral, was fearfully scalded, but bore his tortures\\nmanfully. Both mates were badly scalded, but they stood to their posts,\\nnevertheless. They drew the wood-boat aft, and they and the captain\\nfought back the frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded\\ncould be brought there and placed in safety first.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Wood and Henry fell in the water, they struck out for shore,\\nwhich was only a few hundred yards away; but Henry presently said he\\nbelieved he was not hurt (what an unaccountable error!), and therefore\\nwould swim back to the boat and help save the wounded. So they parted,\\nand Henry returned.\\n\\nBy this time the fire was making fierce headway, and several persons\\nwho were imprisoned under the ruins were begging piteously for help.\\nAll efforts to conquer the fire proved fruitless; so the buckets were\\npresently thrown aside and the officers fell-to with axes and tried to\\ncut the prisoners out. A striker was one of the captives; he said he was\\nnot injured, but could not free himself; and when he saw that the fire\\nwas likely to drive away the workers, he begged that some one would\\nshoot him, and thus save him from the more dreadful death. The fire did\\ndrive the axmen away, and they had to listen, helpless, to this poor\\nfellow's supplications till the flames ended his miseries.\\n\\nThe fire drove all into the wood-flat that could be accommodated there;\\nit was cut adrift, then, and it and the burning steamer floated down\\nthe river toward Ship Island. They moored the flat at the head of the\\nisland, and there, unsheltered from the blazing sun, the half-naked\\noccupants had to remain, without food or stimulants, or help for their\\nhurts, during the rest of the day. A steamer came along, finally,\\nand carried the unfortunates to Memphis, and there the most lavish\\nassistance was at once forthcoming. By this time Henry was insensible.\\nThe physicians examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal, and\\nnaturally turned their main attention to patients who could be saved.\\n\\nForty of the wounded were placed upon pallets on the floor of a great\\npublic hall, and among these was Henry. There the ladies of Memphis\\ncame every day, with flowers, fruits, and dainties and delicacies of\\nall kinds, and there they remained and nursed the wounded. All the\\nphysicians stood watches there, and all the medical students; and the\\nrest of the town furnished money, or whatever else was wanted. And\\nMemphis knew how to do all these things well; for many a disaster\\nlike the 'Pennsylvania's' had happened near her doors, and she was\\nexperienced, above all other cities on the river, in the gracious office\\nof the Good Samaritan.'\\n\\nThe sight I saw when I entered that large hall was new and strange to\\nme. Two long rows of prostrate forms--more than forty, in all--and every\\nface and head a shapeless wad of loose raw cotton. It was a gruesome\\nspectacle. I watched there six days and nights, and a very melancholy\\nexperience it was. There was one daily incident which was peculiarly\\ndepressing: this was the removal of the doomed to a chamber apart. It\\nwas done in order that the _morale _of the other patients might not be\\ninjuriously affected by seeing one of their number in the death-agony.\\nThe fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible,\\nand the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall of assistants;\\nbut no matter: everybody knew what that cluster of bent forms, with\\nits muffled step and its slow movement meant; and all eyes watched it\\nwistfully, and a shudder went abreast of it like a wave.\\n\\nI saw many poor fellows removed to the 'death-room,' and saw them no\\nmore afterward. But I saw our chief mate carried thither more than\\nonce. His hurts were frightful, especially his scalds. He was clothed in\\nlinseed oil and raw cotton to his waist, and resembled nothing human.\\nHe was often out of his mind; and then his pains would make him rave and\\nshout and sometimes shriek. Then, after a period of dumb exhaustion, his\\ndisordered imagination would suddenly transform the great apartment into\\na forecastle, and the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew; and\\nhe would come to a sitting posture and shout, 'Hump yourselves, _hump\\n_yourselves, you petrifactions, snail-bellies, pall-bearers! going to\\nbe all _day_ getting that hatful of freight out?' and supplement this\\nexplosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption or profanity which\\nnothing could stay or stop till his crater was empty. And now and then\\nwhile these frenzies possessed him, he would tear off handfuls of the\\ncotton and expose his cooked flesh to view. It was horrible. It was\\nbad for the others, of course--this noise and these exhibitions; so the\\ndoctors tried to give him morphine to quiet him. But, in his mind or out\\nof it, he would not take it. He said his wife had been killed by that\\ntreacherous drug, and he would die before he would take it. He suspected\\nthat the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary medicines and in his\\nwater--so he ceased from putting either to his lips. Once, when he had\\nbeen without water during two sweltering days, he took the dipper in his\\nhand, and the sight of the limpid fluid, and the misery of his thirst,\\ntempted him almost beyond his strength; but he mastered himself and\\nthrew it away, and after that he allowed no more to be brought near him.\\nThree times I saw him carried to the death-room, insensible and supposed\\nto be dying; but each time he revived, cursed his attendants, and\\ndemanded to be taken back. He lived to be mate of a steamboat again.\\n\\nBut he was the only one who went to the death-room and returned alive.\\nDr. Peyton, a principal physician, and rich in all the attributes that\\ngo to constitute high and flawless character, did all that educated\\njudgment and trained skill could do for Henry; but, as the newspapers\\nhad said in the beginning, his hurts were past help. On the evening of\\nthe sixth day his wandering mind busied itself with matters far away,\\nand his nerveless fingers 'picked at his coverlet.' His hour had struck;\\nwe bore him to the death-room, poor boy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 21\\n\\nA Section in My Biography\\n\\nIN due course I got my license. I was a pilot now, full fledged. I\\ndropped into casual employments; no misfortunes resulting, intermittent\\nwork gave place to steady and protracted engagements. Time drifted\\nsmoothly and prosperously on, and I supposed--and hoped--that I was\\ngoing to follow the river the rest of my days, and die at the wheel\\nwhen my mission was ended. But by and by the war came, commerce was\\nsuspended, my occupation was gone.\\n\\nI had to seek another livelihood. So I became a silver miner in Nevada;\\nnext, a newspaper reporter; next, a gold miner, in California; next, a\\nreporter in San Francisco; next, a special correspondent in the Sandwich\\nIslands; next, a roving correspondent in Europe and the East; next,\\nan instructional torch-bearer on the lecture platform; and, finally, I\\nbecame a scribbler of books, and an immovable fixture among the other\\nrocks of New England.\\n\\nIn so few words have I disposed of the twenty-one slow-drifting years\\nthat have come and gone since I last looked from the windows of a\\npilot-house.\\n\\nLet us resume, now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 22\\n\\nI Return to My Muttons\\n\\nAFTER twenty-one years' absence, I felt a very strong desire to see the\\nriver again, and the steamboats, and such of the boys as might be left;\\nso I resolved to go out there. I enlisted a poet for company, and a\\nstenographer to 'take him down,' and started westward about the middle\\nof April.\\n\\nAs I proposed to make notes, with a view to printing, I took some\\nthought as to methods of procedure. I reflected that if I were\\nrecognized, on the river, I should not be as free to go and come, talk,\\ninquire, and spy around, as I should be if unknown; I remembered that it\\nwas the custom of steamboatmen in the old times to load up the confiding\\nstranger with the most picturesque and admirable lies, and put\\nthe sophisticated friend off with dull and ineffectual facts: so I\\nconcluded, that, from a business point of view, it would be an advantage\\nto disguise our party with fictitious names. The idea was certainly\\ngood, but it bred infinite bother; for although Smith, Jones, and\\nJohnson are easy names to remember when there is no occasion to remember\\nthem, it is next to impossible to recollect them when they are wanted.\\nHow do criminals manage to keep a brand-new _alias _in mind? This is a\\ngreat mystery. I was innocent; and yet was seldom able to lay my hand on\\nmy new name when it was needed; and it seemed to me that if I had had\\na crime on my conscience to further confuse me, I could never have kept\\nthe name by me at all.\\n\\nWe left per Pennsylvania Railroad, at 8 A.M. April 18.\\n\\n'EVENING. Speaking of dress. Grace and picturesqueness drop gradually\\nout of it as one travels away from New York.'\\n\\nI find that among my notes. It makes no difference which direction you\\ntake, the fact remains the same. Whether you move north, south, east,\\nor west, no matter: you can get up in the morning and guess how far you\\nhave come, by noting what degree of grace and picturesqueness is by that\\ntime lacking in the costumes of the new passengers,--I do not mean of\\nthe women alone, but of both sexes. It may be that _carriage _is at the\\nbottom of this thing; and I think it is; for there are plenty of ladies\\nand gentlemen in the provincial cities whose garments are all made\\nby the best tailors and dressmakers of New York; yet this has no\\nperceptible effect upon the grand fact: the educated eye never mistakes\\nthose people for New-Yorkers. No, there is a godless grace, and snap,\\nand style about a born and bred New-Yorker which mere clothing cannot\\neffect.\\n\\n'APRIL 19. This morning, struck into the region of full\\ngoatees--sometimes accompanied by a mustache, but only occasionally.'\\n\\nIt was odd to come upon this thick crop of an obsolete and uncomely\\nfashion; it was like running suddenly across a forgotten acquaintance\\nwhom you had supposed dead for a generation. The goatee extends over\\na wide extent of country; and is accompanied by an iron-clad belief in\\nAdam and the biblical history of creation, which has not suffered from\\nthe assaults of the scientists.\\n\\n'AFTERNOON. At the railway stations the loafers carry _both _hands in\\ntheir breeches pockets; it was observable, heretofore, that one hand\\nwas sometimes out of doors,--here, never. This is an important fact in\\ngeography.'\\n\\nIf the loafers determined the character of a country, it would be still\\nmore important, of course.\\n\\n'Heretofore, all along, the station-loafer has been often observed to\\nscratch one shin with the other foot; here, these remains of activity\\nare wanting. This has an ominous look.'\\n\\nBy and by, we entered the tobacco-chewing region. Fifty years ago, the\\ntobacco-chewing region covered the Union. It is greatly restricted now.\\n\\nNext, boots began to appear. Not in strong force, however. Later--away\\ndown the Mississippi--they became the rule. They disappeared from other\\nsections of the Union with the mud; no doubt they will disappear from\\nthe river villages, also, when proper pavements come in.\\n\\nWe reached St. Louis at ten o'clock at night. At the counter of the\\nhotel I tendered a hurriedly-invented fictitious name, with a miserable\\nattempt at careless ease. The clerk paused, and inspected me in the\\ncompassionate way in which one inspects a respectable person who is\\nfound in doubtful circumstances; then he said--\\n\\n'It's all right; I know what sort of a room you want. Used to clerk at\\nthe St. James, in New York.'\\n\\nAn unpromising beginning for a fraudulent career. We started to the\\nsupper room, and met two other men whom I had known elsewhere. How odd\\nand unfair it is: wicked impostors go around lecturing under my _Nom\\nDe Guerre_ and nobody suspects them; but when an honest man attempts an\\nimposture, he is exposed at once.\\n\\nOne thing seemed plain: we must start down the river the next day, if\\npeople who could not be deceived were going to crop up at this rate:\\nan unpalatable disappointment, for we had hoped to have a week in\\nSt. Louis. The Southern was a good hotel, and we could have had a\\ncomfortable time there. It is large, and well conducted, and its\\ndecorations do not make one cry, as do those of the vast Palmer House,\\nin Chicago. True, the billiard-tables were of the Old Silurian Period,\\nand the cues and balls of the Post-Pliocene; but there was refreshment\\nin this, not discomfort; for there is rest and healing in the\\ncontemplation of antiquities.\\n\\nThe most notable absence observable in the billiard-room, was the\\nabsence of the river man. If he was there he had taken in his sign,\\nhe was in disguise. I saw there none of the swell airs and graces, and\\nostentatious displays of money, and pompous squanderings of it, which\\nused to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in\\nthe bygone days, in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis. In those\\ntimes, the principal saloons were always populous with river men; given\\nfifty players present, thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from\\nthe river. But I suspected that the ranks were thin now, and the\\nsteamboatmen no longer an aristocracy. Why, in my time they used to\\ncall the 'barkeep' Bill, or Joe, or Tom, and slap him on the shoulder;\\nI watched for that. But none of these people did it. Manifestly a glory\\nthat once was had dissolved and vanished away in these twenty-one years.\\n\\nWhen I went up to my room, I found there the young man called Rogers,\\ncrying. Rogers was not his name; neither was Jones, Brown, Dexter,\\nFerguson, Bascom, nor Thompson; but he answered to either of these that\\na body found handy in an emergency; or to any other name, in fact, if he\\nperceived that you meant him. He said--\\n\\n'What is a person to do here when he wants a drink of water?--drink this\\nslush?'\\n\\n'Can't you drink it?'\\n\\n'I could if I had some other water to wash it with.'\\n\\nHere was a thing which had not changed; a score of years had not\\naffected this water's mulatto complexion in the least; a score of\\ncenturies would succeed no better, perhaps. It comes out of the\\nturbulent, bank-caving Missouri, and every tumblerful of it holds nearly\\nan acre of land in solution. I got this fact from the bishop of the\\ndiocese. If you will let your glass stand half an hour, you can separate\\nthe land from the water as easy as Genesis; and then you will find them\\nboth good: the one good to eat, the other good to drink. The land is\\nvery nourishing, the water is thoroughly wholesome. The one appeases\\nhunger; the other, thirst. But the natives do not take them separately,\\nbut together, as nature mixed them. When they find an inch of mud in the\\nbottom of a glass, they stir it up, and then take the draught as they\\nwould gruel. It is difficult for a stranger to get used to this batter,\\nbut once used to it he will prefer it to water. This is really the case.\\nIt is good for steamboating, and good to drink; but it is worthless for\\nall other purposes, except baptizing.\\n\\nNext morning, we drove around town in the rain. The city seemed but\\nlittle changed. It _was _greatly changed, but it did not seem so;\\nbecause in St. Louis, as in London and Pittsburgh, you can't persuade\\na new thing to look new; the coal smoke turns it into an antiquity the\\nmoment you take your hand off it. The place had just about doubled its\\nsize, since I was a resident of it, and was now become a city of 400,000\\ninhabitants; still, in the solid business parts, it looked about as it\\nhad looked formerly. Yet I am sure there is not as much smoke in St.\\nLouis now as there used to be. The smoke used to bank itself in a dense\\nbillowy black canopy over the town, and hide the sky from view. This\\nshelter is very much thinner now; still, there is a sufficiency of smoke\\nthere, I think. I heard no complaint.\\n\\nHowever, on the outskirts changes were apparent enough; notably in\\ndwelling-house architecture. The fine new homes are noble and beautiful\\nand modern. They stand by themselves, too, with green lawns around them;\\nwhereas the dwellings of a former day are packed together in blocks,\\nand are all of one pattern, with windows all alike, set in an arched\\nframe-work of twisted stone; a sort of house which was handsome enough\\nwhen it was rarer.\\n\\nThere was another change--the Forest Park. This was new to me. It is\\nbeautiful and very extensive, and has the excellent merit of having been\\nmade mainly by nature. There are other parks, and fine ones, notably\\nTower Grove and the Botanical Gardens; for St. Louis interested herself\\nin such improvements at an earlier day than did the most of our cities.\\n\\nThe first time I ever saw St. Louis, I could have bought it for six\\nmillion dollars, and it was the mistake of my life that I did not do\\nit. It was bitter now to look abroad over this domed and steepled\\nmetropolis, this solid expanse of bricks and mortar stretching away on\\nevery hand into dim, measure-defying distances, and remember that I had\\nallowed that opportunity to go by. Why I should have allowed it to go\\nby seems, of course, foolish and inexplicable to-day, at a first glance;\\nyet there were reasons at the time to justify this course.\\n\\nA Scotchman, Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, writing some forty-five\\nor fifty years ago, said--'The streets are narrow, ill paved and ill\\nlighted.' Those streets are narrow still, of course; many of them are\\nill paved yet; but the reproach of ill lighting cannot be repeated, now.\\nThe 'Catholic New Church' was the only notable building then, and Mr.\\nMurray was confidently called upon to admire it, with its 'species of\\nGrecian portico, surmounted by a kind of steeple, much too diminutive\\nin its proportions, and surmounted by sundry ornaments' which the\\nunimaginative Scotchman found himself 'quite unable to describe;' and\\ntherefore was grateful when a German tourist helped him out with the\\nexclamation--'By--, they look exactly like bed-posts!' St. Louis is\\nwell equipped with stately and noble public buildings now, and the\\nlittle church, which the people used to be so proud of, lost its\\nimportance a long time ago. Still, this would not surprise Mr. Murray,\\nif he could come back; for he prophesied the coming greatness of St.\\nLouis with strong confidence.\\n\\nThe further we drove in our inspection-tour, the more sensibly I\\nrealized how the city had grown since I had seen it last; changes in\\ndetail became steadily more apparent and frequent than at first, too:\\nchanges uniformly evidencing progress, energy, prosperity.\\n\\nBut the change of changes was on the 'levee.' This time, a departure\\nfrom the rule. Half a dozen sound-asleep steamboats where I used to see\\na solid mile of wide-awake ones! This was melancholy, this was\\nwoeful. The absence of the pervading and jocund steamboatman from the\\nbilliard-saloon was explained. He was absent because he is no more. His\\noccupation is gone, his power has passed away, he is absorbed into the\\ncommon herd, he grinds at the mill, a shorn Samson and inconspicuous.\\nHalf a dozen lifeless steamboats, a mile of empty wharves, a negro\\nfatigued with whiskey stretched asleep, in a wide and soundless vacancy,\\nwhere the serried hosts of commerce used to contend!{footnote [Capt.\\nMarryat, writing forty-five years ago says: 'St. Louis has 20,000\\ninhabitants. _The river abreast of the town is crowded with steamboats,\\nlying in two or three tiers_.']} Here was desolation, indeed.\\n\\n'The old, old sea, as one in tears, Comes murmuring, with foamy lips,\\nAnd knocking at the vacant piers, Calls for his long-lost multitude of\\nships.'\\n\\nThe towboat and the railroad had done their work, and done it well and\\ncompletely. The mighty bridge, stretching along over our heads, had\\ndone its share in the slaughter and spoliation. Remains of former\\nsteamboatmen told me, with wan satisfaction, that the bridge doesn't\\npay. Still, it can be no sufficient compensation to a corpse, to know\\nthat the dynamite that laid him out was not of as good quality as it had\\nbeen supposed to be.\\n\\nThe pavements along the river front were bad: the sidewalks were rather\\nout of repair; there was a rich abundance of mud. All this was familiar\\nand satisfying; but the ancient armies of drays, and struggling throngs\\nof men, and mountains of freight, were gone; and Sabbath reigned in\\ntheir stead. The immemorial mile of cheap foul doggeries remained, but\\nbusiness was dull with them; the multitudes of poison-swilling Irishmen\\nhad departed, and in their places were a few scattering handfuls of\\nragged negroes, some drinking, some drunk, some nodding, others\\nasleep. St. Louis is a great and prosperous and advancing city; but the\\nriver-edge of it seems dead past resurrection.\\n\\nMississippi steamboating was born about 1812; at the end of thirty\\nyears, it had grown to mighty proportions; and in less than thirty\\nmore, it was dead! A strangely short life for so majestic a creature. Of\\ncourse it is not absolutely dead, neither is a crippled octogenarian who\\ncould once jump twenty-two feet on level ground; but as contrasted with\\nwhat it was in its prime vigor, Mississippi steamboating may be called\\ndead.\\n\\nIt killed the old-fashioned keel-boating, by reducing the freight-trip\\nto New Orleans to less than a week. The railroads have killed the\\nsteamboat passenger traffic by doing in two or three days what the\\nsteamboats consumed a week in doing; and the towing-fleets have killed\\nthe through-freight traffic by dragging six or seven steamer-loads of\\nstuff down the river at a time, at an expense so trivial that steamboat\\ncompetition was out of the question.\\n\\nFreight and passenger way-traffic remains to the steamers. This is in\\nthe hands--along the two thousand miles of river between St. Paul and\\nNew Orleans---of two or three close corporations well fortified with\\ncapital; and by able and thoroughly business-like management and system,\\nthese make a sufficiency of money out of what is left of the once\\nprodigious steamboating industry. I suppose that St. Louis and New\\nOrleans have not suffered materially by the change, but alas for the\\nwood-yard man!\\n\\nHe used to fringe the river all the way; his close-ranked merchandise\\nstretched from the one city to the other, along the banks, and he sold\\nuncountable cords of it every year for cash on the nail; but all\\nthe scattering boats that are left burn coal now, and the seldomest\\nspectacle on the Mississippi to-day is a wood-pile. Where now is the\\nonce wood-yard man?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 23\\n\\nTraveling Incognito\\n\\nMY idea was, to tarry a while in every town between St. Louis and New\\nOrleans. To do this, it would be necessary to go from place to place by\\nthe short packet lines. It was an easy plan to make, and would have been\\nan easy one to follow, twenty years ago--but not now. There are wide\\nintervals between boats, these days.\\n\\nI wanted to begin with the interesting old French settlements of St.\\nGenevieve and Kaskaskia, sixty miles below St. Louis. There was only one\\nboat advertised for that section--a Grand Tower packet. Still, one\\nboat was enough; so we went down to look at her. She was a venerable\\nrack-heap, and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for personal\\nproperty, whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her\\nthat she was righteously taxable as real estate. There are places in\\nNew England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty\\ndollars an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good--the new crop\\nof wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected places.\\nThe companionway was of a dry sandy character, and would have been well\\nsuited for grapes, with a southern exposure and a little subsoiling. The\\nsoil of the boiler deck was thin and rocky, but good enough for grazing\\npurposes. A colored boy was on watch here--nobody else visible. We\\ngathered from him that this calm craft would go, as advertised, 'if she\\ngot her trip;' if she didn't get it, she would wait for it.\\n\\n'Has she got any of her trip?'\\n\\n'Bless you, no, boss. She ain't unloadened, yit. She only come in dis\\nmawnin'.'\\n\\nHe was uncertain as to when she might get her trip, but thought it might\\nbe to-morrow or maybe next day. This would not answer at all; so we had\\nto give up the novelty of sailing down the river on a farm. We had one\\nmore arrow in our quiver: a Vicksburg packet, the 'Gold Dust,' was to\\nleave at 5 P.M. We took passage in her for Memphis, and gave up the idea\\nof stopping off here and there, as being impracticable. She was neat,\\nclean, and comfortable. We camped on the boiler deck, and bought some\\ncheap literature to kill time with. The vender was a venerable Irishman\\nwith a benevolent face and a tongue that worked easily in the socket,\\nand from him we learned that he had lived in St. Louis thirty-four years\\nand had never been across the river during that period. Then he wandered\\ninto a very flowing lecture, filled with classic names and allusions,\\nwhich was quite wonderful for fluency until the fact became rather\\napparent that this was not the first time, nor perhaps the fiftieth,\\nthat the speech had been delivered. He was a good deal of a character,\\nand much better company than the sappy literature he was selling. A\\nrandom remark, connecting Irishmen and beer, brought this nugget of\\ninformation out of him--\\n\\nThey don't drink it, sir. They can't drink it, sir. Give an Irishman\\nlager for a month, and he's a dead man. An Irishman is lined with\\ncopper, and the beer corrodes it. But whiskey polishes the copper and is\\nthe saving of him, sir.'\\n\\nAt eight o'clock, promptly, we backed out and crossed the river. As we\\ncrept toward the shore, in the thick darkness, a blinding glory of white\\nelectric light burst suddenly from our forecastle, and lit up the\\nwater and the warehouses as with a noon-day glare. Another big\\nchange, this--no more flickering, smoky, pitch-dripping, ineffectual\\ntorch-baskets, now: their day is past. Next, instead of calling out a\\nscore of hands to man the stage, a couple of men and a hatful of\\nsteam lowered it from the derrick where it was suspended, launched it,\\ndeposited it in just the right spot, and the whole thing was over\\nand done with before a mate in the olden time could have got his\\nprofanity-mill adjusted to begin the preparatory services. Why this new\\nand simple method of handling the stages was not thought of when the\\nfirst steamboat was built, is a mystery which helps one to realize what\\na dull-witted slug the average human being is.\\n\\nWe finally got away at two in the morning, and when I turned out at\\nsix, we were rounding to at a rocky point where there was an old\\nstone warehouse--at any rate, the ruins of it; two or three decayed\\ndwelling-houses were near by, in the shelter of the leafy hills; but\\nthere were no evidences of human or other animal life to be seen.\\nI wondered if I had forgotten the river; for I had no recollection\\nwhatever of this place; the shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar;\\nthere was nothing in sight, anywhere, that I could remember ever having\\nseen before. I was surprised, disappointed, and annoyed.\\n\\nWe put ashore a well-dressed lady and gentleman, and two well-dressed,\\nlady-like young girls, together with sundry Russia-leather bags. A\\nstrange place for such folk! No carriage was waiting. The party moved\\noff as if they had not expected any, and struck down a winding country\\nroad afoot.\\n\\nBut the mystery was explained when we got under way again; for these\\npeople were evidently bound for a large town which lay shut in behind\\na tow-head (i.e., new island) a couple of miles below this landing.\\nI couldn't remember that town; I couldn't place it, couldn't call its\\nname. So I lost part of my temper. I suspected that it might be St.\\nGenevieve--and so it proved to be. Observe what this eccentric river had\\nbeen about: it had built up this huge useless tow-head directly in\\nfront of this town, cut off its river communications, fenced it away\\ncompletely, and made a 'country' town of it. It is a fine old place,\\ntoo, and deserved a better fate. It was settled by the French, and is a\\nrelic of a time when one could travel from the mouths of the Mississippi\\nto Quebec and be on French territory and under French rule all the way.\\n\\nPresently I ascended to the hurricane deck and cast a longing glance\\ntoward the pilot-house.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 24\\n\\nMy Incognito is Exploded\\n\\nAFTER a close study of the face of the pilot on watch, I was satisfied\\nthat I had never seen him before; so I went up there. The pilot\\ninspected me; I re-inspected the pilot. These customary preliminaries\\nover, I sat down on the high bench, and he faced about and went on with\\nhis work. Every detail of the pilot-house was familiar to me, with one\\nexception,--a large-mouthed tube under the breast-board. I puzzled over\\nthat thing a considerable time; then gave up and asked what it was for.\\n\\n'To hear the engine-bells through.'\\n\\nIt was another good contrivance which ought to have been invented half a\\ncentury sooner. So I was thinking, when the pilot asked--\\n\\n'Do you know what this rope is for?'\\n\\nI managed to get around this question, without committing myself.\\n\\n'Is this the first time you were ever in a pilot-house?'\\n\\nI crept under that one.\\n\\n'Where are you from?'\\n\\n'New England.'\\n\\n'First time you have ever been West?'\\n\\nI climbed over this one.\\n\\n'If you take an interest in such things, I can tell you what all these\\nthings are for.'\\n\\nI said I should like it.\\n\\n'This,' putting his hand on a backing-bell rope, 'is to sound the\\nfire-alarm; this,' putting his hand on a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the\\ntexas-tender; this one,' indicating the whistle-lever, 'is to call the\\ncaptain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and\\nreeling off his tranquil spool of lies.\\n\\nI had never felt so like a passenger before. I thanked him, with\\nemotion, for each new fact, and wrote it down in my note-book. The\\npilot warmed to his opportunity, and proceeded to load me up in the good\\nold-fashioned way. At times I was afraid he was going to rupture his\\ninvention; but it always stood the strain, and he pulled through all\\nright. He drifted, by easy stages, into revealments of the river's\\nmarvelous eccentricities of one sort and another, and backed them up\\nwith some pretty gigantic illustrations. For instance--\\n\\n'Do you see that little boulder sticking out of the water yonder? well,\\nwhen I first came on the river, that was a solid ridge of rock, over\\nsixty feet high and two miles long. All washed away but that.' [This\\nwith a sigh.]\\n\\nI had a mighty impulse to destroy him, but it seemed to me that killing,\\nin any ordinary way, would be too good for him.\\n\\nOnce, when an odd-looking craft, with a vast coal-scuttle slanting aloft\\non the end of a beam, was steaming by in the distance, he indifferently\\ndrew attention to it, as one might to an object grown wearisome through\\nfamiliarity, and observed that it was an 'alligator boat.'\\n\\n'An alligator boat? What's it for?'\\n\\n'To dredge out alligators with.'\\n\\n'Are they so thick as to be troublesome?'\\n\\n'Well, not now, because the Government keeps them down. But they used\\nto be. Not everywhere; but in favorite places, here and there, where\\nthe river is wide and shoal-like Plum Point, and Stack Island, and so\\non--places they call alligator beds.'\\n\\n'Did they actually impede navigation?'\\n\\n'Years ago, yes, in very low water; there was hardly a trip, then, that\\nwe didn't get aground on alligators.'\\n\\nIt seemed to me that I should certainly have to get out my tomahawk.\\nHowever, I restrained myself and said--\\n\\n'It must have been dreadful.'\\n\\n'Yes, it was one of the main difficulties about piloting. It was so\\nhard to tell anything about the water; the damned things shift around\\nso--never lie still five minutes at a time. You can tell a wind-reef,\\nstraight off, by the look of it; you can tell a break; you can tell a\\nsand-reef--that's all easy; but an alligator reef doesn't show up, worth\\nanything. Nine times in ten you can't tell where the water is; and when\\nyou do see where it is, like as not it ain't there when _you _get there,\\nthe devils have swapped around so, meantime. Of course there were some\\nfew pilots that could judge of alligator water nearly as well as they\\ncould of any other kind, but they had to have natural talent for it; it\\nwasn't a thing a body could learn, you had to be born with it. Let\\nme see: there was Ben Thornburg, and Beck Jolly, and Squire Bell, and\\nHorace Bixby, and Major Downing, and John Stevenson, and Billy Gordon,\\nand Jim Brady, and George Ealer, and Billy Youngblood--all A-1 alligator\\npilots. _They _could tell alligator water as far as another Christian\\ncould tell whiskey. Read it?--Ah, _couldn't_ they, though! I only wish I\\nhad as many dollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a half\\noff. Yes, and it paid them to do it, too. A good alligator pilot could\\nalways get fifteen hundred dollars a month. Nights, other people had to\\nlay up for alligators, but those fellows never laid up for alligators;\\nthey never laid up for anything but fog. They could _smell _the best\\nalligator water it was said; I don't know whether it was so or not, and\\nI think a body's got his hands full enough if he sticks to just what he\\nknows himself, without going around backing up other people's say-so's,\\nthough there's a plenty that ain't backward about doing it, as long as\\nthey can roust out something wonderful to tell. Which is not the style\\nof Robert Styles, by as much as three fathom--maybe quarter-_less_.'\\n\\n[My! Was this Rob Styles?--This mustached and stately figure?-A\\nslim enough cub, in my time. How he has improved in comeliness in\\nfive-and-twenty year and in the noble art of inflating his facts.] After\\nthese musings, I said aloud--\\n\\n'I should think that dredging out the alligators wouldn't have done much\\ngood, because they could come back again right away.'\\n\\n'If you had had as much experience of alligators as I have, you wouldn't\\ntalk like that. You dredge an alligator once and he's _convinced_. It's\\nthe last you hear of _him_. He wouldn't come back for pie. If there's\\none thing that an alligator is more down on than another, it's being\\ndredged. Besides, they were not simply shoved out of the way; the most\\nof the scoopful were scooped aboard; they emptied them into the\\nhold; and when they had got a trip, they took them to Orleans to the\\nGovernment works.'\\n\\n'What for?'\\n\\n'Why, to make soldier-shoes out of their hides. All the Government shoes\\nare made of alligator hide. It makes the best shoes in the world. They\\nlast five years, and they won't absorb water. The alligator fishery is\\na Government monopoly. All the alligators are Government property--just\\nlike the live-oaks. You cut down a live-oak, and Government fines you\\nfifty dollars; you kill an alligator, and up you go for misprision\\nof treason--lucky duck if they don't hang you, too. And they will, if\\nyou're a Democrat. The buzzard is the sacred bird of the South, and you\\ncan't touch him; the alligator is the sacred bird of the Government, and\\nyou've got to let him alone.'\\n\\n'Do you ever get aground on the alligators now?'\\n\\n'Oh, no! it hasn't happened for years.'\\n\\n'Well, then, why do they still keep the alligator boats in service?'\\n\\n'Just for police duty--nothing more. They merely go up and down now\\nand then. The present generation of alligators know them as easy as a\\nburglar knows a roundsman; when they see one coming, they break camp and\\ngo for the woods.'\\n\\nAfter rounding-out and finishing-up and polishing-off the alligator\\nbusiness, he dropped easily and comfortably into the historical vein,\\nand told of some tremendous feats of half-a-dozen old-time steamboats\\nof his acquaintance, dwelling at special length upon a certain\\nextraordinary performance of his chief favorite among this distinguished\\nfleet--and then adding--\\n\\n'That boat was the “_Cyclone_,”--last trip she ever made--she sunk, that\\nvery trip--captain was Tom Ballou, the most immortal liar that ever I\\nstruck. He couldn't ever seem to tell the truth, in any kind of weather.\\nWhy, he would make you fairly shudder. He _was _the most scandalous\\nliar! I left him, finally; I couldn't stand it. The proverb says, “like\\nmaster, like man;” and if you stay with that kind of a man, you'll come\\nunder suspicion by and by, just as sure as you live. He paid first-class\\nwages; but said I, What's wages when your reputation's in danger? So I\\nlet the wages go, and froze to my reputation. And I've never regretted\\nit. Reputation's worth everything, ain't it? That's the way I look at\\nit. He had more selfish organs than any seven men in the world--all\\npacked in the stern-sheets of his skull, of course, where they belonged.\\nThey weighed down the back of his head so that it made his nose tilt up\\nin the air. People thought it was vanity, but it wasn't, it was malice.\\nIf you only saw his foot, you'd take him to be nineteen feet high, but\\nhe wasn't; it was because his foot was out of drawing. He was intended\\nto be nineteen feet high, no doubt, if his foot was made first, but he\\ndidn't get there; he was only five feet ten. That's what he was, and\\nthat's what he is. You take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the\\nsize of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear.\\nThat “Cyclone” was a rattler to go, and the sweetest thing to steer that\\never walked the waters. Set her amidships, in a big river, and just let\\nher go; it was all you had to do. She would hold herself on a star\\nall night, if you let her alone. You couldn't ever feel her rudder. It\\nwasn't any more labor to steer her than it is to count the Republican\\nvote in a South Carolina election. One morning, just at daybreak, the\\nlast trip she ever made, they took her rudder aboard to mend it; I\\ndidn't know anything about it; I backed her out from the wood-yard\\nand went a-weaving down the river all serene. When I had gone about\\ntwenty-three miles, and made four horribly crooked crossings--'\\n\\n'Without any rudder?'\\n\\n'Yes--old Capt. Tom appeared on the roof and began to find fault with me\\nfor running such a dark night--'\\n\\n'Such a _dark night_?--Why, you said--'\\n\\n'Never mind what I said,--'twas as dark as Egypt now, though pretty soon\\nthe moon began to rise, and--'\\n\\n'You mean the _sun_--because you started out just at break of--look\\nhere! Was this _before _you quitted the captain on account of his lying,\\nor--'\\n\\n'It was before--oh, a long time before. And as I was saying, he--'\\n\\n'But was this the trip she sunk, or was--'\\n\\n'Oh, no!--months afterward. And so the old man, he--'\\n\\n'Then she made _two _last trips, because you said--'\\n\\nHe stepped back from the wheel, swabbing away his perspiration, and\\nsaid--\\n\\n'Here!' (calling me by name), '_you _take her and lie a while--you're\\nhandier at it than I am. Trying to play yourself for a stranger and an\\ninnocent!--why, I knew you before you had spoken seven words; and I made\\nup my mind to find out what was your little game. It was to _draw me\\nout_. Well, I let you, didn't I? Now take the wheel and finish the\\nwatch; and next time play fair, and you won't have to work your\\npassage.'\\n\\nThus ended the fictitious-name business. And not six hours out from St.\\nLouis! but I had gained a privilege, any way, for I had been itching\\nto get my hands on the wheel, from the beginning. I seemed to have\\nforgotten the river, but I hadn't forgotten how to steer a steamboat,\\nnor how to enjoy it, either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 25\\n\\nFrom Cairo to Hickman\\n\\nTHE scenery, from St. Louis to Cairo--two hundred miles--is varied and\\nbeautiful. The hills were clothed in the fresh foliage of spring now,\\nand were a gracious and worthy setting for the broad river flowing\\nbetween. Our trip began auspiciously, with a perfect day, as to\\nbreeze and sunshine, and our boat threw the miles out behind her with\\nsatisfactory despatch.\\n\\nWe found a railway intruding at Chester, Illinois; Chester has also a\\npenitentiary now, and is otherwise marching on. At Grand Tower, too,\\nthere was a railway; and another at Cape Girardeau. The former town gets\\nits name from a huge, squat pillar of rock, which stands up out of the\\nwater on the Missouri side of the river--a piece of nature's fanciful\\nhandiwork--and is one of the most picturesque features of the scenery of\\nthat region. For nearer or remoter neighbors, the Tower has the Devil's\\nBake Oven--so called, perhaps, because it does not powerfully resemble\\nanybody else's bake oven; and the Devil's Tea Table--this latter a great\\nsmooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishing wine-glass stem, perched\\nsome fifty or sixty feet above the river, beside a beflowered and\\ngarlanded precipice, and sufficiently like a tea-table to answer for\\nanybody, Devil or Christian. Away down the river we have the Devil's\\nElbow and the Devil's Race-course, and lots of other property of his\\nwhich I cannot now call to mind.\\n\\nThe Town of Grand Tower was evidently a busier place than it had been in\\nold times, but it seemed to need some repairs here and there, and a new\\ncoat of whitewash all over. Still, it was pleasant to me to see the old\\ncoat once more. 'Uncle' Mumford, our second officer, said the place had\\nbeen suffering from high water, and consequently was not looking its\\nbest now. But he said it was not strange that it didn't waste white-wash\\non itself, for more lime was made there, and of a better quality, than\\nanywhere in the West; and added--'On a dairy farm you never can get any\\nmilk for your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation; and it\\nis against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash.' In my own\\nexperience I knew the first two items to be true; and also that people\\nwho sell candy don't care for candy; therefore there was plausibility in\\nUncle Mumford's final observation that 'people who make lime run more to\\nreligion than whitewash.' Uncle Mumford said, further, that Grand Tower\\nwas a great coaling center and a prospering place.\\n\\nCape Girardeau is situated on a hillside, and makes a handsome\\nappearance. There is a great Jesuit school for boys at the foot of the\\ntown by the river. Uncle Mumford said it had as high a reputation for\\nthoroughness as any similar institution in Missouri! There was another\\ncollege higher up on an airy summit--a bright new edifice, picturesquely\\nand peculiarly towered and pinnacled--a sort of gigantic casters, with\\nthe cruets all complete. Uncle Mumford said that Cape Girardeau was the\\nAthens of Missouri, and contained several colleges besides those already\\nmentioned; and all of them on a religious basis of one kind or another.\\nHe directed my attention to what he called the 'strong and pervasive\\nreligious look of the town,' but I could not see that it looked more\\nreligious than the other hill towns with the same slope and built of the\\nsame kind of bricks. Partialities often make people see more than really\\nexists.\\n\\nUncle Mumford has been thirty years a mate on the river. He is a man of\\npractical sense and a level head; has observed; has had much experience\\nof one sort and another; has opinions; has, also, just a perceptible\\ndash of poetry in his composition, an easy gift of speech, a thick\\ngrowl in his voice, and an oath or two where he can get at them when the\\nexigencies of his office require a spiritual lift. He is a mate of the\\nblessed old-time kind; and goes gravely damning around, when there is\\nwork to the fore, in a way to mellow the ex-steamboatman's heart with\\nsweet soft longings for the vanished days that shall come no more.\\n'_Git _up there you! Going to be all day? Why d'n't you _say _you was\\npetrified in your hind legs, before you shipped!'\\n\\nHe is a steady man with his crew; kind and just, but firm; so they\\nlike him, and stay with him. He is still in the slouchy garb of the\\nold generation of mates; but next trip the Anchor Line will have him in\\nuniform--a natty blue naval uniform, with brass buttons, along with all\\nthe officers of the line--and then he will be a totally different style\\nof scenery from what he is now.\\n\\nUniforms on the Mississippi! It beats all the other changes put\\ntogether, for surprise. Still, there is another surprise--that it was\\nnot made fifty years ago. It is so manifestly sensible, that it might\\nhave been thought of earlier, one would suppose. During fifty years, out\\nthere, the innocent passenger in need of help and information, has been\\nmistaking the mate for the cook, and the captain for the barber--and\\nbeing roughly entertained for it, too. But his troubles are ended now.\\nAnd the greatly improved aspect of the boat's staff is another advantage\\nachieved by the dress-reform period.\\n\\nSteered down the bend below Cape Girardeau. They used to call it\\n'Steersman's Bend;' plain sailing and plenty of water in it, always;\\nabout the only place in the Upper River that a new cub was allowed to\\ntake a boat through, in low water.\\n\\nThebes, at the head of the Grand Chain, and Commerce at the foot of it,\\nwere towns easily rememberable, as they had not undergone conspicuous\\nalteration. Nor the Chain, either--in the nature of things; for it is a\\nchain of sunken rocks admirably arranged to capture and kill steamboats\\non bad nights. A good many steamboat corpses lie buried there, out of\\nsight; among the rest my first friend the 'Paul Jones;' she knocked her\\nbottom out, and went down like a pot, so the historian told me--Uncle\\nMumford. He said she had a gray mare aboard, and a preacher. To me,\\nthis sufficiently accounted for the disaster; as it did, of course, to\\nMumford, who added--\\n\\n'But there are many ignorant people who would scoff at such a matter,\\nand call it superstition. But you will always notice that they are\\npeople who have never traveled with a gray mare and a preacher. I went\\ndown the river once in such company. We grounded at Bloody Island; we\\ngrounded at Hanging Dog; we grounded just below this same Commerce;\\nwe jolted Beaver Dam Rock; we hit one of the worst breaks in the\\n'Graveyard' behind Goose Island; we had a roustabout killed in a fight;\\nwe burnt a boiler; broke a shaft; collapsed a flue; and went into Cairo\\nwith nine feet of water in the hold--may have been more, may have been\\nless. I remember it as if it were yesterday. The men lost their heads\\nwith terror. They painted the mare blue, in sight of town, and threw the\\npreacher overboard, or we should not have arrived at all. The preacher\\nwas fished out and saved. He acknowledged, himself, that he had been to\\nblame. I remember it all, as if it were yesterday.'\\n\\nThat this combination--of preacher and gray mare--should breed calamity,\\nseems strange, and at first glance unbelievable; but the fact is\\nfortified by so much unassailable proof that to doubt is to dishonor\\nreason. I myself remember a case where a captain was warned by numerous\\nfriends against taking a gray mare and a preacher with him, but\\npersisted in his purpose in spite of all that could be said; and the\\nsame day--it may have been the next, and some say it was, though I think\\nit was the same day--he got drunk and fell down the hatchway, and was\\nborne to his home a corpse. This is literally true.\\n\\nNo vestige of Hat Island is left now; every shred of it is washed away.\\nI do not even remember what part of the river it used to be in,\\nexcept that it was between St. Louis and Cairo somewhere. It was a bad\\nregion--all around and about Hat Island, in early days. A farmer who\\nlived on the Illinois shore there, said that twenty-nine steamboats had\\nleft their bones strung along within sight from his house. Between\\nSt. Louis and Cairo the steamboat wrecks average one to the mile;--two\\nhundred wrecks, altogether.\\n\\nI could recognize big changes from Commerce down. Beaver Dam Rock was\\nout in the middle of the river now, and throwing a prodigious 'break;'\\nit used to be close to the shore, and boats went down outside of it.\\nA big island that used to be away out in mid-river, has retired to the\\nMissouri shore, and boats do not go near it any more. The island called\\nJacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now, and is booked for early\\ndestruction. Goose Island is all gone but a little dab the size of a\\nsteamboat. The perilous 'Graveyard,' among whose numberless wrecks\\nwe used to pick our way so slowly and gingerly, is far away from the\\nchannel now, and a terror to nobody. One of the islands formerly called\\nthe Two Sisters is gone entirely; the other, which used to lie close\\nto the Illinois shore, is now on the Missouri side, a mile away; it is\\njoined solidly to the shore, and it takes a sharp eye to see where the\\nseam is--but it is Illinois ground yet, and the people who live on\\nit have to ferry themselves over and work the Illinois roads and pay\\nIllinois taxes: singular state of things!\\n\\nNear the mouth of the river several islands were missing--washed away.\\nCairo was still there--easily visible across the long, flat point upon\\nwhose further verge it stands; but we had to steam a long way around\\nto get to it. Night fell as we were going out of the 'Upper River' and\\nmeeting the floods of the Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety; for\\nthe hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream\\na long distance out of the channel; or rather, about one county has gone\\ninto the river from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has 'made\\ndown' and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly. The\\nMississippi is a just and equitable river; it never tumbles one man's\\nfarm overboard without building a new farm just like it for that man's\\nneighbor. This keeps down hard feelings.\\n\\nGoing into Cairo, we came near killing a steamboat which paid no\\nattention to our whistle and then tried to cross our bows. By doing some\\nstrong backing, we saved him; which was a great loss, for he would have\\nmade good literature.\\n\\nCairo is a brisk town now; and is substantially built, and has a city\\nlook about it which is in noticeable contrast to its former estate, as\\nper Mr. Dickens's portrait of it. However, it was already building with\\nbricks when I had seen it last--which was when Colonel (now General)\\nGrant was drilling his first command there. Uncle Mumford says the\\nlibraries and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo, as well as\\nthe brick masons. Cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade, and her\\nsituation at the junction of the two great rivers is so advantageous\\nthat she cannot well help prospering.\\n\\nWhen I turned out, in the morning, we had passed Columbus, Kentucky,\\nand were approaching Hickman, a pretty town, perched on a handsome hill.\\nHickman is in a rich tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a great and\\nlucrative trade in that staple, collecting it there in her warehouses\\nfrom a large area of country and shipping it by boat; but Uncle Mumford\\nsays she built a railway to facilitate this commerce a little more, and\\nhe thinks it facilitated it the wrong way--took the bulk of the trade\\nout of her hands by 'collaring it along the line without gathering it at\\nher doors.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 26\\n\\nUnder Fire\\n\\nTALK began to run upon the war now, for we were getting down into the\\nupper edge of the former battle-stretch by this time. Columbus was just\\nbehind us, so there was a good deal said about the famous battle of\\nBelmont. Several of the boat's officers had seen active service in the\\nMississippi war-fleet. I gathered that they found themselves sadly out\\nof their element in that kind of business at first, but afterward got\\naccustomed to it, reconciled to it, and more or less at home in it. One\\nof our pilots had his first war experience in the Belmont fight, as a\\npilot on a boat in the Confederate service. I had often had a curiosity\\nto know how a green hand might feel, in his maiden battle, perched all\\nsolitary and alone on high in a pilot house, a target for Tom, Dick\\nand Harry, and nobody at his elbow to shame him from showing the white\\nfeather when matters grew hot and perilous around him; so, to me his\\nstory was valuable--it filled a gap for me which all histories had left\\ntill that time empty.\\n\\nTHE PILOT'S FIRST BATTLE\\n\\nHe said--\\n\\nIt was the 7th of November. The fight began at seven in the morning. I\\nwas on the 'R. H. W. Hill.' Took over a load of troops from Columbus.\\nCame back, and took over a battery of artillery. My partner said he\\nwas going to see the fight; wanted me to go along. I said, no, I wasn't\\nanxious, I would look at it from the pilot-house. He said I was a\\ncoward, and left.\\n\\nThat fight was an awful sight. General Cheatham made his men strip their\\ncoats off and throw them in a pile, and said, 'Now follow me to hell\\nor victory!' I heard him say that from the pilot-house; and then he\\ngalloped in, at the head of his troops. Old General Pillow, with his\\nwhite hair, mounted on a white horse, sailed in, too, leading his troops\\nas lively as a boy. By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and\\nhere they came! tearing along, everybody for himself and Devil take the\\nhindmost! and down under the bank they scrambled, and took shelter. I\\nwas sitting with my legs hanging out of the pilot-house window. All at\\nonce I noticed a whizzing sound passing my ear. Judged it was a bullet.\\nI didn't stop to think about anything, I just tilted over backwards and\\nlanded on the floor, and staid there. The balls came booming around.\\nThree cannon-balls went through the chimney; one ball took off the\\ncorner of the pilot-house; shells were screaming and bursting all\\naround. Mighty warm times--I wished I hadn't come.\\n\\nI lay there on the pilot-house floor, while the shots came faster\\nand faster. I crept in behind the big stove, in the middle of the\\npilot-house. Presently a minie-ball came through the stove, and just\\ngrazed my head, and cut my hat. I judged it was time to go away\\nfrom there. The captain was on the roof with a red-headed major from\\nMemphis--a fine-looking man. I heard him say he wanted to leave here,\\nbut 'that pilot is killed.' I crept over to the starboard side to pull\\nthe bell to set her back; raised up and took a look, and I saw about\\nfifteen shot holes through the window panes; had come so lively I hadn't\\nnoticed them. I glanced out on the water, and the spattering shot were\\nlike a hailstorm. I thought best to get out of that place. I went down\\nthe pilot-house guy, head first--not feet first but head first--slid\\ndown--before I struck the deck, the captain said we must leave there. So\\nI climbed up the guy and got on the floor again. About that time, they\\ncollared my partner and were bringing him up to the pilot-house between\\ntwo soldiers. Somebody had said I was killed. He put his head in and saw\\nme on the floor reaching for the backing bells. He said, 'Oh, hell, he\\nain't shot,' and jerked away from the men who had him by the collar, and\\nran below. We were there until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then\\ngot away all right.\\n\\nThe next time I saw my partner, I said, 'Now, come out, be honest, and\\ntell me the truth. Where did you go when you went to see that battle?'\\nHe says, 'I went down in the hold.'\\n\\nAll through that fight I was scared nearly to death. I hardly knew\\nanything, I was so frightened; but you see, nobody knew that but me.\\nNext day General Polk sent for me, and praised me for my bravery and\\ngallant conduct. I never said anything, I let it go at that. I judged it\\nwasn't so, but it was not for me to contradict a general officer.\\n\\nPretty soon after that I was sick, and used up, and had to go off to\\nthe Hot Springs. When there, I got a good many letters from commanders\\nsaying they wanted me to come back. I declined, because I wasn't well\\nenough or strong enough; but I kept still, and kept the reputation I had\\nmade.\\n\\nA plain story, straightforwardly told; but Mumford told me that that\\npilot had 'gilded that scare of his, in spots;' that his subsequent\\ncareer in the war was proof of it.\\n\\nWe struck down through the chute of Island No. 8, and I went below\\nand fell into conversation with a passenger, a handsome man, with easy\\ncarriage and an intelligent face. We were approaching Island No. 10,\\na place so celebrated during the war. This gentleman's home was on the\\nmain shore in its neighborhood. I had some talk with him about the war\\ntimes; but presently the discourse fell upon 'feuds,' for in no part of\\nthe South has the vendetta flourished more briskly, or held out longer\\nbetween warring families, than in this particular region. This gentleman\\nsaid--\\n\\n'There's been more than one feud around here, in old times, but I reckon\\nthe worst one was between the Darnells and the Watsons. Nobody don't\\nknow now what the first quarrel was about, it's so long ago; the\\nDarnells and the Watsons don't know, if there's any of them living,\\nwhich I don't think there is. Some says it was about a horse or a\\ncow--anyway, it was a little matter; the money in it wasn't of no\\nconsequence--none in the world--both families was rich. The thing could\\nhave been fixed up, easy enough; but no, that wouldn't do. Rough words\\nhad been passed; and so, nothing but blood could fix it up after that.\\nThat horse or cow, whichever it was, cost sixty years of killing and\\ncrippling! Every year or so somebody was shot, on one side or the other;\\nand as fast as one generation was laid out, their sons took up the feud\\nand kept it a-going. And it's just as I say; they went on shooting each\\nother, year in and year out--making a kind of a religion of it, you\\nsee--till they'd done forgot, long ago, what it was all about. Wherever\\na Darnell caught a Watson, or a Watson caught a Darnell, one of 'em was\\ngoing to get hurt--only question was, which of them got the drop on\\nthe other. They'd shoot one another down, right in the presence of the\\nfamily. They didn't hunt for each other, but when they happened to meet,\\nthey puffed and begun. Men would shoot boys, boys would shoot men. A man\\nshot a boy twelve years old--happened on him in the woods, and didn't\\ngive him no chance. If he _had _'a' given him a chance, the boy'd 'a'\\nshot him. Both families belonged to the same church (everybody around\\nhere is religious); through all this fifty or sixty years' fuss, both\\ntribes was there every Sunday, to worship. They lived each side of the\\nline, and the church was at a landing called Compromise. Half the church\\nand half the aisle was in Kentucky, the other half in Tennessee. Sundays\\nyou'd see the families drive up, all in their Sunday clothes, men,\\nwomen, and children, and file up the aisle, and set down, quiet and\\norderly, one lot on the Tennessee side of the church and the other on\\nthe Kentucky side; and the men and boys would lean their guns up against\\nthe wall, handy, and then all hands would join in with the prayer and\\npraise; though they say the man next the aisle didn't kneel down, along\\nwith the rest of the family; kind of stood guard. I don't know; never\\nwas at that church in my life; but I remember that that's what used to\\nbe said.\\n\\n'Twenty or twenty-five years ago, one of the feud families caught a\\nyoung man of nineteen out and killed him. Don't remember whether it was\\nthe Darnells and Watsons, or one of the other feuds; but anyway, this\\nyoung man rode up--steamboat laying there at the time--and the first\\nthing he saw was a whole gang of the enemy. He jumped down behind a\\nwood-pile, but they rode around and begun on him, he firing back, and\\nthey galloping and cavorting and yelling and banging away with all their\\nmight. Think he wounded a couple of them; but they closed in on him\\nand chased him into the river; and as he swum along down stream, they\\nfollowed along the bank and kept on shooting at him; and when he struck\\nshore he was dead. Windy Marshall told me about it. He saw it. He was\\ncaptain of the boat.\\n\\n'Years ago, the Darnells was so thinned out that the old man and his two\\nsons concluded they'd leave the country. They started to take steamboat\\njust above No. 10; but the Watsons got wind of it; and they arrived just\\nas the two young Darnells was walking up the companion-way with their\\nwives on their arms. The fight begun then, and they never got no\\nfurther--both of them killed. After that, old Darnell got into trouble\\nwith the man that run the ferry, and the ferry-man got the worst\\nof it--and died. But his friends shot old Darnell through and\\nthrough--filled him full of bullets, and ended him.'\\n\\nThe country gentleman who told me these things had been reared in ease\\nand comfort, was a man of good parts, and was college bred. His loose\\ngrammar was the fruit of careless habit, not ignorance. This habit\\namong educated men in the West is not universal, but it is\\nprevalent--prevalent in the towns, certainly, if not in the cities; and\\nto a degree which one cannot help noticing, and marveling at. I heard a\\nWesterner who would be accounted a highly educated man in any country,\\nsay 'never mind, it _don't make no difference_, anyway.' A life-long\\nresident who was present heard it, but it made no impression upon her.\\nShe was able to recall the fact afterward, when reminded of it; but\\nshe confessed that the words had not grated upon her ear at the\\ntime--a confession which suggests that if educated people can hear such\\nblasphemous grammar, from such a source, and be unconscious of the deed,\\nthe crime must be tolerably common--so common that the general ear has\\nbecome dulled by familiarity with it, and is no longer alert, no longer\\nsensitive to such affronts.\\n\\nNo one in the world speaks blemishless grammar; no one has ever written\\nit--_no_ one, either in the world or out of it (taking the Scriptures\\nfor evidence on the latter point); therefore it would not be fair to\\nexact grammatical perfection from the peoples of the Valley; but they\\nand all other peoples may justly be required to refrain from _knowingly\\nand purposely_ debauching their grammar.\\n\\nI found the river greatly changed at Island No. 10. The island which\\nI remembered was some three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide,\\nheavily timbered, and lay near the Kentucky shore--within two hundred\\nyards of it, I should say. Now, however, one had to hunt for it with a\\nspy-glass. Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft, and\\nthis was no longer near the Kentucky shore; it was clear over against\\nthe opposite shore, a mile away. In war times the island had been an\\nimportant place, for it commanded the situation; and, being heavily\\nfortified, there was no getting by it. It lay between the upper and\\nlower divisions of the Union forces, and kept them separate, until a\\njunction was finally effected across the Missouri neck of land; but the\\nisland being itself joined to that neck now, the wide river is without\\nobstruction.\\n\\nIn this region the river passes from Kentucky into Tennessee, back into\\nMissouri, then back into Kentucky, and thence into Tennessee again. So a\\nmile or two of Missouri sticks over into Tennessee.\\n\\nThe town of New Madrid was looking very unwell; but otherwise unchanged\\nfrom its former condition and aspect. Its blocks of frame-houses were\\nstill grouped in the same old flat plain, and environed by the same\\nold forests. It was as tranquil as formerly, and apparently had neither\\ngrown nor diminished in size. It was said that the recent high water had\\ninvaded it and damaged its looks. This was surprising news; for in low\\nwater the river bank is very high there (fifty feet), and in my day an\\noverflow had always been considered an impossibility. This present flood\\nof 1882 Will doubtless be celebrated in the river's history for several\\ngenerations before a deluge of like magnitude shall be seen. It put all\\nthe unprotected low lands under water, from Cairo to the mouth; it broke\\ndown the levees in a great many places, on both sides of the river;\\nand in some regions south, when the flood was at its highest, the\\nMississippi was _seventy miles_ wide! a number of lives were lost,\\nand the destruction of property was fearful. The crops were destroyed,\\nhouses washed away, and shelterless men and cattle forced to take refuge\\non scattering elevations here and there in field and forest, and wait\\nin peril and suffering until the boats put in commission by the national\\nand local governments and by newspaper enterprise could come and rescue\\nthem. The properties of multitudes of people were under water for\\nmonths, and the poorer ones must have starved by the hundred if succor\\nhad not been promptly afforded.{footnote [For a detailed and interesting\\ndescription of the great flood, written on board of the New Orleans\\n_Times-Democrat's_ relief-boat, see Appendix A]} The water had been\\nfalling during a considerable time now, yet as a rule we found the banks\\nstill under water.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 27\\n\\nSome Imported Articles\\n\\nWE met two steamboats at New Madrid. Two steamboats in sight at once! an\\ninfrequent spectacle now in the lonesome Mississippi. The loneliness\\nof this solemn, stupendous flood is impressive--and depressing. League\\nafter league, and still league after league, it pours its chocolate tide\\nalong, between its solid forest walls, its almost untenanted shores,\\nwith seldom a sail or a moving object of any kind to disturb the surface\\nand break the monotony of the blank, watery solitude; and so the day\\ngoes, the night comes, and again the day--and still the same, night\\nafter night and day after day--majestic, unchanging sameness of\\nserenity, repose, tranquillity, lethargy, vacancy--symbol of eternity,\\nrealization of the heaven pictured by priest and prophet, and longed for\\nby the good and thoughtless!\\n\\nImmediately after the war of 1812, tourists began to come to America,\\nfrom England; scattering ones at first, then a sort of procession of\\nthem--a procession which kept up its plodding, patient march through the\\nland during many, many years. Each tourist took notes, and went home and\\npublished a book--a book which was usually calm, truthful, reasonable,\\nkind; but which seemed just the reverse to our tender-footed\\nprogenitors. A glance at these tourist-books shows us that in certain\\nof its aspects the Mississippi has undergone no change since those\\nstrangers visited it, but remains to-day about as it was then. The\\nemotions produced in those foreign breasts by these aspects were not\\nall formed on one pattern, of course; they _had _to be various, along\\nat first, because the earlier tourists were obliged to originate their\\nemotions, whereas in older countries one can always borrow emotions\\nfrom one's predecessors. And, mind you, emotions are among the toughest\\nthings in the world to manufacture out of whole cloth; it is easier\\nto manufacture seven facts than one emotion. Captain Basil Hall. R.N.,\\nwriting fifty-five years ago, says--\\n\\n'Here I caught the first glimpse of the object I had so long wished to\\nbehold, and felt myself amply repaid at that moment for all the trouble\\nI had experienced in coming so far; and stood looking at the river\\nflowing past till it was too dark to distinguish anything. But it was\\nnot till I had visited the same spot a dozen times, that I came to a\\nright comprehension of the grandeur of the scene.'\\n\\nFollowing are Mrs. Trollope's emotions. She is writing a few months\\nlater in the same year, 1827, and is coming in at the mouth of the\\nMississippi--\\n\\n'The first indication of our approach to land was the appearance of this\\nmighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters, and mingling with\\nthe deep blue of the Mexican Gulf. I never beheld a scene so utterly\\ndesolate as this entrance of the Mississippi. Had Dante seen it, he\\nmight have drawn images of another Borgia from its horrors. One only\\nobject rears itself above the eddying waters; this is the mast of a\\nvessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross the bar, and it still\\nstands, a dismal witness of the destruction that has been, and a boding\\nprophet of that which is to come.'\\n\\nEmotions of Hon. Charles Augustus Murray (near St. Louis), seven years\\nlater--\\n\\n'It is only when you ascend the mighty current for fifty or a hundred\\nmiles, and use the eye of imagination as well as that of nature,\\nthat you begin to understand all his might and majesty. You see him\\nfertilizing a boundless valley, bearing along in his course the trophies\\nof his thousand victories over the shattered forest--here carrying away\\nlarge masses of soil with all their growth, and there forming islands,\\ndestined at some future period to be the residence of man; and while\\nindulging in this prospect, it is then time for reflection to suggest\\nthat the current before you has flowed through two or three thousand\\nmiles, and has yet to travel one thousand three hundred more before\\nreaching its ocean destination.'\\n\\nReceive, now, the emotions of Captain Marryat, R.N. author of the sea\\ntales, writing in 1837, three years after Mr. Murray--\\n\\n'Never, perhaps, in the records of nations, was there an instance of a\\ncentury of such unvarying and unmitigated crime as is to be collected\\nfrom the history of the turbulent and blood-stained Mississippi. The\\nstream itself appears as if appropriate for the deeds which have been\\ncommitted. It is not like most rivers, beautiful to the sight, bestowing\\nfertility in its course; not one that the eye loves to dwell upon as\\nit sweeps along, nor can you wander upon its banks, or trust yourself\\nwithout danger to its stream. It is a furious, rapid, desolating\\ntorrent, loaded with alluvial soil; and few of those who are received\\ninto its waters ever rise again, {footnote [There was a foolish\\nsuperstition of some little prevalence in that day, that the Mississippi\\nwould neither buoy up a swimmer, nor permit a drowned person's body to\\nrise to the surface.]} or can support themselves long upon its surface\\nwithout assistance from some friendly log. It contains the coarsest and\\nmost uneatable of fish, such as the cat-fish and such genus, and as\\nyou descend, its banks are occupied with the fetid alligator, while the\\npanther basks at its edge in the cane-brakes, almost impervious to man.\\nPouring its impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees of\\nlittle value except for firewood, it sweeps down whole forests in its\\ncourse, which disappear in tumultuous confusion, whirled away by the\\nstream now loaded with the masses of soil which nourished their roots,\\noften blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the river,\\nwhich, as if in anger at its being opposed, inundates and devastates the\\nwhole country round; and as soon as it forces its way through its former\\nchannel, plants in every direction the uprooted monarchs of the forest\\n(upon whose branches the bird will never again perch, or the raccoon,\\nthe opossum, or the squirrel climb) as traps to the adventurous\\nnavigators of its waters by steam, who, borne down upon these concealed\\ndangers which pierce through the planks, very often have not time to\\nsteer for and gain the shore before they sink to the bottom. There are\\nno pleasing associations connected with the great common sewer of\\nthe Western America, which pours out its mud into the Mexican Gulf,\\npolluting the clear blue sea for many miles beyond its mouth. It is a\\nriver of desolation; and instead of reminding you, like other beautiful\\nrivers, of an angel which has descended for the benefit of man, you\\nimagine it a devil, whose energies have been only overcome by the\\nwonderful power of steam.'\\n\\nIt is pretty crude literature for a man accustomed to handling a pen;\\nstill, as a panorama of the emotions sent weltering through this noted\\nvisitor's breast by the aspect and traditions of the 'great common\\nsewer,' it has a value. A value, though marred in the matter of\\nstatistics by inaccuracies; for the catfish is a plenty good enough fish\\nfor anybody, and there are no panthers that are 'impervious to man.'\\n\\nLater still comes Alexander Mackay, of the Middle Temple, Barrister at\\nLaw, with a better digestion, and no catfish dinner aboard, and feels as\\nfollows--\\n\\n'The Mississippi! It was with indescribable emotions that I first felt\\nmyself afloat upon its waters. How often in my schoolboy dreams, and in\\nmy waking visions afterwards, had my imagination pictured to itself the\\nlordly stream, rolling with tumultuous current through the boundless\\nregion to which it has given its name, and gathering into itself, in its\\ncourse to the ocean, the tributary waters of almost every latitude in\\nthe temperate zone! Here it was then in its reality, and I, at length,\\nsteaming against its tide. I looked upon it with that reverence with\\nwhich everyone must regard a great feature of external nature.'\\n\\nSo much for the emotions. The tourists, one and all, remark upon the\\ndeep, brooding loneliness and desolation of the vast river. Captain\\nBasil Hall, who saw it at flood-stage, says--\\n\\n'Sometimes we passed along distances of twenty or thirty miles without\\nseeing a single habitation. An artist, in search of hints for a painting\\nof the deluge, would here have found them in abundance.'\\n\\nThe first shall be last, etc. just two hundred years ago, the old\\noriginal first and gallantest of all the foreign tourists, pioneer, head\\nof the procession, ended his weary and tedious discovery-voyage down the\\nsolemn stretches of the great river--La Salle, whose name will last as\\nlong as the river itself shall last. We quote from Mr. Parkman--\\n\\n'And now they neared their journey's end. On the sixth of April, the\\nriver divided itself into three broad channels. La Salle followed that\\nof the west, and D'Autray that of the east; while Tonty took the middle\\npassage. As he drifted down the turbid current, between the low and\\nmarshy shores, the brackish water changed to brine, and the breeze grew\\nfresh with the salt breath of the sea. Then the broad bosom of the\\ngreat Gulf opened on his sight, tossing its restless billows, limitless,\\nvoiceless, lonely as when born of chaos, without a sail, without a sign\\nof life.'\\n\\nThen, on a spot of solid ground, La Salle reared a column 'bearing the\\narms of France; the Frenchmen were mustered under arms; and while the\\nNew England Indians and their squaws looked on in wondering silence,\\nthey chanted the _Te Deum, The Exaudiat_, and the _Domine Salvum Fac\\nRegem_.'\\n\\nThen, whilst the musketry volleyed and rejoicing shouts burst forth,\\nthe victorious discoverer planted the column, and made proclamation in a\\nloud voice, taking formal possession of the river and the vast\\ncountries watered by it, in the name of the King. The column bore this\\ninscription--\\n\\nLOUIS LE GRAND, ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE, REGNE; LE NEUVIEME AVRIL,\\n1682.\\n\\nNew Orleans intended to fittingly celebrate, this present year, the\\nbicentennial anniversary of this illustrious event; but when the\\ntime came, all her energies and surplus money were required in other\\ndirections, for the flood was upon the land then, making havoc and\\ndevastation everywhere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 28\\n\\nUncle Mumford Unloads\\n\\nALL day we swung along down the river, and had the stream almost wholly\\nto ourselves. Formerly, at such a stage of the water, we should have\\npassed acres of lumber rafts, and dozens of big coal barges; also\\noccasional little trading-scows, peddling along from farm to farm, with\\nthe peddler's family on board; possibly, a random scow, bearing a humble\\nHamlet and Co. on an itinerant dramatic trip. But these were all absent.\\nFar along in the day, we saw one steamboat; just one, and no more. She\\nwas lying at rest in the shade, within the wooded mouth of the Obion\\nRiver. The spy-glass revealed the fact that she was named for me--or\\n_he_ was named for me, whichever you prefer. As this was the first time\\nI had ever encountered this species of honor, it seems excusable to\\nmention it, and at the same time call the attention of the authorities\\nto the tardiness of my recognition of it.\\n\\nNoted a big change in the river, at Island 21. It was a very large\\nisland, and used to be out toward mid-stream; but it is joined fast to\\nthe main shore now, and has retired from business as an island.\\n\\nAs we approached famous and formidable Plum Point, darkness fell, but\\nthat was nothing to shudder about--in these modern times. For now\\nthe national government has turned the Mississippi into a sort of\\ntwo-thousand-mile torchlight procession. In the head of every crossing,\\nand in the foot of every crossing, the government has set up a\\nclear-burning lamp. You are never entirely in the dark, now; there is\\nalways a beacon in sight, either before you, or behind you, or abreast.\\nOne might almost say that lamps have been squandered there. Dozens of\\ncrossings are lighted which were not shoal when they were created,\\nand have never been shoal since; crossings so plain, too, and also so\\nstraight, that a steamboat can take herself through them without any\\nhelp, after she has been through once. Lamps in such places are of\\ncourse not wasted; it is much more convenient and comfortable for a\\npilot to hold on them than on a spread of formless blackness that won't\\nstay still; and money is saved to the boat, at the same time, for she\\ncan of course make more miles with her rudder amidships than she can\\nwith it squared across her stern and holding her back.\\n\\nBut this thing has knocked the romance out of piloting, to a large\\nextent. It, and some other things together, have knocked all the romance\\nout of it. For instance, the peril from snags is not now what it once\\nwas. The government's snag-boats go patrolling up and down, in these\\nmatter-of-fact days, pulling the river's teeth; they have rooted out\\nall the old clusters which made many localities so formidable; and they\\nallow no new ones to collect. Formerly, if your boat got away from you,\\non a black night, and broke for the woods, it was an anxious time with\\nyou; so was it also, when you were groping your way through solidified\\ndarkness in a narrow chute; but all that is changed now--you flash out\\nyour electric light, transform night into day in the twinkling of an\\neye, and your perils and anxieties are at an end. Horace Bixby and\\nGeorge Ritchie have charted the crossings and laid out the courses\\nby compass; they have invented a lamp to go with the chart, and have\\npatented the whole. With these helps, one may run in the fog now, with\\nconsiderable security, and with a confidence unknown in the old days.\\n\\nWith these abundant beacons, the banishment of snags, plenty of daylight\\nin a box and ready to be turned on whenever needed, and a chart and\\ncompass to fight the fog with, piloting, at a good stage of water, is\\nnow nearly as safe and simple as driving stage, and is hardly more than\\nthree times as romantic.\\n\\nAnd now in these new days, these days of infinite change, the Anchor\\nLine have raised the captain above the pilot by giving him the bigger\\nwages of the two. This was going far, but they have not stopped there.\\nThey have decreed that the pilot shall remain at his post, and stand\\nhis watch clear through, whether the boat be under way or tied up to the\\nshore. We, that were once the aristocrats of the river, can't go to bed\\nnow, as we used to do, and sleep while a hundred tons of freight are\\nlugged aboard; no, we must sit in the pilot-house; and keep awake, too.\\nVerily we are being treated like a parcel of mates and engineers. The\\nGovernment has taken away the romance of our calling; the Company has\\ntaken away its state and dignity.\\n\\nPlum Point looked as it had always looked by night, with the exception\\nthat now there were beacons to mark the crossings, and also a lot of\\nother lights on the Point and along its shore; these latter glinting\\nfrom the fleet of the United States River Commission, and from a village\\nwhich the officials have built on the land for offices and for the\\nemployees of the service. The military engineers of the Commission\\nhave taken upon their shoulders the job of making the Mississippi over\\nagain--a job transcended in size by only the original job of creating\\nit. They are building wing-dams here and there, to deflect the current;\\nand dikes to confine it in narrower bounds; and other dikes to make it\\nstay there; and for unnumbered miles along the Mississippi, they are\\nfelling the timber-front for fifty yards back, with the purpose of\\nshaving the bank down to low-water mark with the slant of a house roof,\\nand ballasting it with stones; and in many places they have protected\\nthe wasting shores with rows of piles. One who knows the Mississippi\\nwill promptly aver--not aloud, but to himself--that ten thousand River\\nCommissions, with the mines of the world at their back, cannot tame that\\nlawless stream, cannot curb it or confine it, cannot say to it, Go\\nhere, or Go there, and make it obey; cannot save a shore which it has\\nsentenced; cannot bar its path with an obstruction which it will not\\ntear down, dance over, and laugh at. But a discreet man will not put\\nthese things into spoken words; for the West Point engineers have not\\ntheir superiors anywhere; they know all that can be known of their\\nabstruse science; and so, since they conceive that they can fetter and\\nhandcuff that river and boss him, it is but wisdom for the unscientific\\nman to keep still, lie low, and wait till they do it. Captain Eads,\\nwith his jetties, has done a work at the mouth of the Mississippi which\\nseemed clearly impossible; so we do not feel full confidence now to\\nprophesy against like impossibilities. Otherwise one would pipe out and\\nsay the Commission might as well bully the comets in their courses and\\nundertake to make them behave, as try to bully the Mississippi into\\nright and reasonable conduct.\\n\\nI consulted Uncle Mumford concerning this and cognate matters; and I\\ngive here the result, stenographically reported, and therefore to be\\nrelied on as being full and correct; except that I have here and there\\nleft out remarks which were addressed to the men, such as 'where in\\nblazes are you going with that barrel now?' and which seemed to me to\\nbreak the flow of the written statement, without compensating by adding\\nto its information or its clearness. Not that I have ventured to\\nstrike out all such interjections; I have removed only those which were\\nobviously irrelevant; wherever one occurred which I felt any question\\nabout, I have judged it safest to let it remain.\\n\\nUNCLE MUMFORD'S IMPRESSIONS\\n\\nUncle Mumford said--\\n\\n'As long as I have been mate of a steamboat--thirty years--I have\\nwatched this river and studied it. Maybe I could have learnt more about\\nit at West Point, but if I believe it I wish I may be _what are you\\nsucking your fingers there for ?--collar that kag of nails!_ Four years\\nat West Point, and plenty of books and schooling, will learn a man a\\ngood deal, I reckon, but it won't learn him the river. You turn one\\nof those little European rivers over to this Commission, with its hard\\nbottom and clear water, and it would just be a holiday job for them to\\nwall it, and pile it, and dike it, and tame it down, and boss it around,\\nand make it go wherever they wanted it to, and stay where they put it,\\nand do just as they said, every time. But this ain't that kind of a\\nriver. They have started in here with big confidence, and the best\\nintentions in the world; but they are going to get left. What does\\nEcclesiastes vii. 13 say? Says enough to knock _their _little game\\ngalley-west, don't it? Now you look at their methods once. There at\\nDevil's Island, in the Upper River, they wanted the water to go one way,\\nthe water wanted to go another. So they put up a stone wall. But what\\ndoes the river care for a stone wall? When it got ready, it just bulged\\nthrough it. Maybe they can build another that will stay; that is, up\\nthere--but not down here they can't. Down here in the Lower River, they\\ndrive some pegs to turn the water away from the shore and stop it from\\nslicing off the bank; very well, don't it go straight over and cut\\nsomebody else's bank? Certainly. Are they going to peg all the banks?\\nWhy, they could buy ground and build a new Mississippi cheaper. They are\\npegging Bulletin Tow-head now. It won't do any good. If the river has\\ngot a mortgage on that island, it will foreclose, sure, pegs or no pegs.\\nAway down yonder, they have driven two rows of piles straight through\\nthe middle of a dry bar half a mile long, which is forty foot out of the\\nwater when the river is low. What do you reckon that is for? If I know,\\nI wish I may land in--_hump yourself, you son of an undertaker!--out\\nwith that coal-oil, now, lively, lively!_ And just look at what they are\\ntrying to do down there at Milliken's Bend. There's been a cut-off in\\nthat section, and Vicksburg is left out in the cold. It's a country town\\nnow. The river strikes in below it; and a boat can't go up to the town\\nexcept in high water. Well, they are going to build wing-dams in the\\nbend opposite the foot of 103, and throw the water over and cut off the\\nfoot of the island and plow down into an old ditch where the river\\nused to be in ancient times; and they think they can persuade the water\\naround that way, and get it to strike in above Vicksburg, as it used\\nto do, and fetch the town back into the world again. That is, they are\\ngoing to take this whole Mississippi, and twist it around and make it\\nrun several miles _up stream_. Well you've got to admire men that deal\\nin ideas of that size and can tote them around without crutches; but you\\nhaven't got to believe they can _do_ such miracles, have you! And yet\\nyou ain't absolutely obliged to believe they can't. I reckon the safe\\nway, where a man can afford it, is to copper the operation, and at the\\nsame time buy enough property in Vicksburg to square you up in case they\\nwin. Government is doing a deal for the Mississippi, now--spending loads\\nof money on her. When there used to be four thousand steamboats and ten\\nthousand acres of coal-barges, and rafts and trading scows, there wasn't\\na lantern from St. Paul to New Orleans, and the snags were thicker than\\nbristles on a hog's back; and now when there's three dozen steamboats\\nand nary barge or raft, Government has snatched out all the snags, and\\nlit up the shores like Broadway, and a boat's as safe on the river as\\nshe'd be in heaven. And I reckon that by the time there ain't any boats\\nleft at all, the Commission will have the old thing all reorganized, and\\ndredged out, and fenced in, and tidied up, to a degree that will make\\nnavigation just simply perfect, and absolutely safe and profitable; and\\nall the days will be Sundays, and all the mates will be Sunday-school\\nsu----_what-in-the-nation-you-fooling-around-there-for, you sons of\\nunrighteousness, heirs of perdition! going to be a year getting that\\nhogshead ashore?'_\\n\\nDuring our trip to New Orleans and back, we had many conversations\\nwith river men, planters, journalists, and officers of the River\\nCommission--with conflicting and confusing results. To wit:--\\n\\n1. Some believed in the Commission's scheme to arbitrarily and\\npermanently confine (and thus deepen) the channel, preserve threatened\\nshores, etc.\\n\\n2. Some believed that the Commission's money ought to be spent only on\\nbuilding and repairing the great system of levees.\\n\\n3. Some believed that the higher you build your levee, the higher the\\nriver's bottom will rise; and that consequently the levee system is a\\nmistake.\\n\\n4. Some believed in the scheme to relieve the river, in flood-time, by\\nturning its surplus waters off into Lake Borgne, etc.\\n\\n5. Some believed in the scheme of northern lake-reservoirs to replenish\\nthe Mississippi in low-water seasons.\\n\\nWherever you find a man down there who believes in one of these theories\\nyou may turn to the next man and frame your talk upon the hypothesis\\nthat he does not believe in that theory; and after you have had\\nexperience, you do not take this course doubtfully, or hesitatingly, but\\nwith the confidence of a dying murderer--converted one, I mean. For you\\nwill have come to know, with a deep and restful certainty, that you are\\nnot going to meet two people sick of the same theory, one right after\\nthe other. No, there will always be one or two with the other diseases\\nalong between. And as you proceed, you will find out one or two other\\nthings. You will find out that there is no distemper of the lot but is\\ncontagious; and you cannot go where it is without catching it. You may\\nvaccinate yourself with deterrent facts as much as you please--it will\\ndo no good; it will seem to 'take,' but it doesn't; the moment you rub\\nagainst any one of those theorists, make up your mind that it is time to\\nhang out your yellow flag.\\n\\nYes, you are his sure victim: yet his work is not all to your hurt--only\\npart of it; for he is like your family physician, who comes and cures\\nthe mumps, and leaves the scarlet-fever behind. If your man is a\\nLake-Borgne-relief theorist, for instance, he will exhale a cloud of\\ndeadly facts and statistics which will lay you out with that disease,\\nsure; but at the same time he will cure you of any other of the five\\ntheories that may have previously got into your system.\\n\\nI have had all the five; and had them 'bad;' but ask me not, in mournful\\nnumbers, which one racked me hardest, or which one numbered the biggest\\nsick list, for I do not know. In truth, no one can answer the latter\\nquestion. Mississippi Improvement is a mighty topic, down yonder. Every\\nman on the river banks, south of Cairo, talks about it every day, during\\nsuch moments as he is able to spare from talking about the war; and each\\nof the several chief theories has its host of zealous partisans; but,\\nas I have said, it is not possible to determine which cause numbers the\\nmost recruits.\\n\\nAll were agreed upon one point, however: if Congress would make a\\nsufficient appropriation, a colossal benefit would result. Very well;\\nsince then the appropriation has been made--possibly a sufficient one,\\ncertainly not too large a one. Let us hope that the prophecy will be\\namply fulfilled.\\n\\nOne thing will be easily granted by the reader; that an opinion from Mr.\\nEdward Atkinson, upon any vast national commercial matter, comes as near\\nranking as authority, as can the opinion of any individual in the Union.\\nWhat he has to say about Mississippi River Improvement will be found in\\nthe Appendix.{footnote [See Appendix B.]}\\n\\nSometimes, half a dozen figures will reveal, as with a lightning-flash,\\nthe importance of a subject which ten thousand labored words, with the\\nsame purpose in view, had left at last but dim and uncertain. Here is a\\ncase of the sort--paragraph from the 'Cincinnati Commercial'--\\n\\n'The towboat “Jos. B. Williams” is on her way to New Orleans with a\\ntow of thirty-two barges, containing six hundred thousand bushels\\n(seventy-six pounds to the bushel) of coal exclusive of her own fuel,\\nbeing the largest tow ever taken to New Orleans or anywhere else in the\\nworld. Her freight bill, at 3 cents a bushel, amounts to $18,000. It\\nwould take eighteen hundred cars, of three hundred and thirty-three\\nbushels to the car, to transport this amount of coal. At $10 per ton, or\\n$100 per car, which would be a fair price for the distance by rail, the\\nfreight bill would amount to $180,000, or $162,000 more by rail than by\\nriver. The tow will be taken from Pittsburg to New Orleans in fourteen\\nor fifteen days. It would take one hundred trains of eighteen cars to\\nthe train to transport this one tow of six hundred thousand bushels\\nof coal, and even if it made the usual speed of fast freight lines, it\\nwould take one whole summer to put it through by rail.'\\n\\nWhen a river in good condition can enable one to save $162,000 and a\\nwhole summer's time, on a single cargo, the wisdom of taking measures to\\nkeep the river in good condition is made plain to even the uncommercial\\nmind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 29\\n\\nA Few Specimen Bricks\\n\\nWE passed through the Plum Point region, turned Craighead's Point,\\nand glided unchallenged by what was once the formidable Fort Pillow,\\nmemorable because of the massacre perpetrated there during the war.\\nMassacres are sprinkled with some frequency through the histories of\\nseveral Christian nations, but this is almost the only one that can be\\nfound in American history; perhaps it is the only one which rises to a\\nsize correspondent to that huge and somber title. We have the 'Boston\\nMassacre,' where two or three people were killed; but we must bunch\\nAnglo-Saxon history together to find the fellow to the Fort Pillow\\ntragedy; and doubtless even then we must travel back to the days and the\\nperformances of Coeur de Lion, that fine 'hero,' before we accomplish\\nit.\\n\\nMore of the river's freaks. In times past, the channel used to strike\\nabove Island 37, by Brandywine Bar, and down towards Island 39.\\nAfterward, changed its course and went from Brandywine down through\\nVogelman's chute in the Devil's Elbow, to Island 39--part of this course\\nreversing the old order; the river running _up_ four or five miles,\\ninstead of down, and cutting off, throughout, some fifteen miles of\\ndistance. This in 1876. All that region is now called Centennial Island.\\n\\nThere is a tradition that Island 37 was one of the principal abiding\\nplaces of the once celebrated 'Murel's Gang.' This was a colossal\\ncombination of robbers, horse-thieves, negro-stealers, and\\ncounterfeiters, engaged in business along the river some fifty or sixty\\nyears ago. While our journey across the country towards St. Louis was in\\nprogress we had had no end of Jesse James and his stirring history; for\\nhe had just been assassinated by an agent of the Governor of Missouri,\\nand was in consequence occupying a good deal of space in the newspapers.\\nCheap histories of him were for sale by train boys. According to these,\\nhe was the most marvelous creature of his kind that had ever existed. It\\nwas a mistake. Murel was his equal in boldness; in pluck; in rapacity;\\nin cruelty, brutality, heartlessness, treachery, and in general and\\ncomprehensive vileness and shamelessness; and very much his superior\\nin some larger aspects. James was a retail rascal; Murel, wholesale.\\nJames's modest genius dreamed of no loftier flight than the planning\\nof raids upon cars, coaches, and country banks; Murel projected negro\\ninsurrections and the capture of New Orleans; and furthermore, on\\noccasion, this Murel could go into a pulpit and edify the congregation.\\nWhat are James and his half-dozen vulgar rascals compared with this\\nstately old-time criminal, with his sermons, his meditated insurrections\\nand city-captures, and his majestic following of ten hundred men, sworn\\nto do his evil will!\\n\\nHere is a paragraph or two concerning this big operator, from a now\\nforgotten book which was published half a century ago--\\n\\nHe appears to have been a most dexterous as well as consummate villain.\\nWhen he traveled, his usual disguise was that of an itinerant preacher;\\nand it is said that his discourses were very 'soul-moving'--interesting\\nthe hearers so much that they forgot to look after their horses, which\\nwere carried away by his confederates while he was preaching. But the\\nstealing of horses in one State, and selling them in another, was but\\na small portion of their business; the most lucrative was the enticing\\nslaves to run away from their masters, that they might sell them in\\nanother quarter. This was arranged as follows; they would tell a negro\\nthat if he would run away from his master, and allow them to sell him,\\nhe should receive a portion of the money paid for him, and that upon his\\nreturn to them a second time they would send him to a free State, where\\nhe would be safe.\\n\\nThe poor wretches complied with this request, hoping to obtain money and\\nfreedom; they would be sold to another master, and run away again, to\\ntheir employers; sometimes they would be sold in this manner three or\\nfour times, until they had realized three or four thousand dollars by\\nthem; but as, after this, there was fear of detection, the usual custom\\nwas to get rid of the only witness that could be produced against them,\\nwhich was the negro himself, by murdering him, and throwing his body\\ninto the Mississippi. Even if it was established that they had stolen\\na negro, before he was murdered, they were always prepared to evade\\npunishment; for they concealed the negro who had run away, until he\\nwas advertised, and a reward offered to any man who would catch him. An\\nadvertisement of this kind warrants the person to take the property, if\\nfound. And then the negro becomes a property in trust, when, therefore,\\nthey sold the negro, it only became a breach of trust, not stealing; and\\nfor a breach of trust, the owner of the property can only have redress\\nby a civil action, which was useless, as the damages were never paid.\\nIt may be inquired, how it was that Murel escaped Lynch law under such\\ncircumstances This will be easily understood when it is stated that he\\nhad _more than a thousand sworn confederates_, all ready at a moment's\\nnotice to support any of the gang who might be in trouble. The names of\\nall the principal confederates of Murel were obtained from himself, in\\na manner which I shall presently explain. The gang was composed of two\\nclasses: the Heads or Council, as they were called, who planned and\\nconcerted, but seldom acted; they amounted to about four hundred.\\nThe other class were the active agents, and were termed strikers, and\\namounted to about six hundred and fifty. These were the tools in the\\nhands of the others; they ran all the risk, and received but a small\\nportion of the money; they were in the power of the leaders of the gang,\\nwho would sacrifice them at any time by handing them over to justice, or\\nsinking their bodies in the Mississippi. The general rendezvous of this\\ngang of miscreants was on the Arkansas side of the river, where they\\nconcealed their negroes in the morasses and cane-brakes.\\n\\nThe depredations of this extensive combination were severely felt; but\\nso well were their plans arranged, that although Murel, who was always\\nactive, was everywhere suspected, there was no proof to be obtained. It\\nso happened, however, that a young man of the name of Stewart, who was\\nlooking after two slaves which Murel had decoyed away, fell in with him\\nand obtained his confidence, took the oath, and was admitted into the\\ngang as one of the General Council. By this means all was discovered;\\nfor Stewart turned traitor, although he had taken the oath, and having\\nobtained every information, exposed the whole concern, the names of all\\nthe parties, and finally succeeded in bringing home sufficient\\nevidence against Murel, to procure his conviction and sentence to the\\nPenitentiary (Murel was sentenced to fourteen years' imprisonment); so\\nmany people who were supposed to be honest, and bore a respectable name\\nin the different States, were found to be among the list of the Grand\\nCouncil as published by Stewart, that every attempt was made to throw\\ndiscredit upon his assertions--his character was vilified, and more\\nthan one attempt was made to assassinate him. He was obliged to quit the\\nSouthern States in consequence. It is, however, now well ascertained\\nto have been all true; and although some blame Mr. Stewart for having\\nviolated his oath, they no longer attempt to deny that his revelations\\nwere correct. I will quote one or two portions of Murel's confessions to\\nMr. Stewart, made to him when they were journeying together. I ought to\\nhave observed, that the ultimate intentions of Murel and his associates\\nwere, by his own account, on a very extended scale; having no less\\nan object in view than _raising the blacks against the whites, taking\\npossession of, and plundering new orleans, and making themselves\\npossessors of the territory_. The following are a few extracts:--\\n\\n'I collected all my friends about New Orleans at one of our friends'\\nhouses in that place, and we sat in council three days before we got all\\nour plans to our notion; we then determined to undertake the rebellion\\nat every hazard, and make as many friends as we could for that purpose.\\nEvery man's business being assigned him, I started to Natchez on foot,\\nhaving sold my horse in New Orleans,--with the intention of stealing\\nanother after I started. I walked four days, and no opportunity offered\\nfor me to get a horse. The fifth day, about twelve, I had become tired,\\nand stopped at a creek to get some water and rest a little. While I was\\nsitting on a log, looking down the road the way that I had come, a man\\ncame in sight riding on a good-looking horse. The very moment I saw him,\\nI was determined to have his horse, if he was in the garb of a traveler.\\nHe rode up, and I saw from his equipage that he was a traveler. I arose\\nand drew an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered him to dismount. He\\ndid so, and I took his horse by the bridle and pointed down the creek,\\nand ordered him to walk before me. He went a few hundred yards and\\nstopped. I hitched his horse, and then made him undress himself, all to\\nhis shirt and drawers, and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said,\\n'If you are determined to kill me, let me have time to pray before I\\ndie,' I told him I had no time to hear him pray. He turned around and\\ndropped on his knees, and I shot him through the back of the head.\\n\\nI ripped open his belly and took out his entrails, and sunk him in the\\ncreek. I then searched his pockets, and found four hundred dollars and\\nthirty-seven cents, and a number of papers that I did not take time to\\nexamine. I sunk the pocket-book and papers and his hat, in the creek.\\nHis boots were brand-new, and fitted me genteelly; and I put them on\\nand sunk my old shoes in the creek, to atone for them. I rolled up his\\nclothes and put them into his portmanteau, as they were brand-new cloth\\nof the best quality. I mounted as fine a horse as ever I straddled, and\\ndirected my course for Natchez in much better style than I had been for\\nthe last five days.\\n\\n'Myself and a fellow by the name of Crenshaw gathered four good horses\\nand started for Georgia. We got in company with a young South Carolinian\\njust before we got to Cumberland Mountain, and Crenshaw soon knew all\\nabout his business. He had been to Tennessee to buy a drove of hogs, but\\nwhen he got there pork was dearer than he calculated, and he declined\\npurchasing. We concluded he was a prize. Crenshaw winked at me; I\\nunderstood his idea. Crenshaw had traveled the road before, but I never\\nhad; we had traveled several miles on the mountain, when he passed near\\na great precipice; just before we passed it Crenshaw asked me for my\\nwhip, which had a pound of lead in the butt; I handed it to him, and he\\nrode up by the side of the South Carolinian, and gave him a blow on the\\nside of the head and tumbled him from his horse; we lit from our horses\\nand fingered his pockets; we got twelve hundred and sixty-two dollars.\\nCrenshaw said he knew a place to hide him, and he gathered him under his\\narms, and I by his feet, and conveyed him to a deep crevice in the brow\\nof the precipice, and tumbled him into it, and he went out of sight; we\\nthen tumbled in his saddle, and took his horse with us, which was worth\\ntwo hundred dollars.\\n\\n'We were detained a few days, and during that time our friend went to a\\nlittle village in the neighborhood and saw the negro advertised (a negro\\nin our possession), and a description of the two men of whom he had been\\npurchased, and giving his suspicions of the men. It was rather squally\\ntimes, but any port in a storm: we took the negro that night on the bank\\nof a creek which runs by the farm of our friend, and Crenshaw shot him\\nthrough the head. We took out his entrails and sunk him in the creek.\\n\\n'He had sold the other negro the third time on Arkansaw River for\\nupwards of five hundred dollars; and then stole him and delivered him\\ninto the hand of his friend, who conducted him to a swamp, and veiled\\nthe tragic scene, and got the last gleanings and sacred pledge of\\nsecrecy; as a game of that kind will not do unless it ends in a mystery\\nto all but the fraternity. He sold the negro, first and last, for nearly\\ntwo thousand dollars, and then put him for ever out of the reach of all\\npursuers; and they can never graze him unless they can find the negro;\\nand that they cannot do, for his carcass has fed many a tortoise and\\ncatfish before this time, and the frogs have sung this many a long day\\nto the silent repose of his skeleton.'\\n\\nWe were approaching Memphis, in front of which city, and witnessed by\\nits people, was fought the most famous of the river battles of the Civil\\nWar. Two men whom I had served under, in my river days, took part in\\nthat fight: Mr. Bixby, head pilot of the Union fleet, and Montgomery,\\nCommodore of the Confederate fleet. Both saw a great deal of active\\nservice during the war, and achieved high reputations for pluck and\\ncapacity.\\n\\nAs we neared Memphis, we began to cast about for an excuse to stay\\nwith the 'Gold Dust' to the end of her course--Vicksburg. We were so\\npleasantly situated, that we did not wish to make a change. I had an\\nerrand of considerable importance to do at Napoleon, Arkansas, but\\nperhaps I could manage it without quitting the 'Gold Dust.' I said as\\nmuch; so we decided to stick to present quarters.\\n\\nThe boat was to tarry at Memphis till ten the next morning. It is a\\nbeautiful city, nobly situated on a commanding bluff overlooking the\\nriver. The streets are straight and spacious, though not paved in a way\\nto incite distempered admiration. No, the admiration must be reserved\\nfor the town's sewerage system, which is called perfect; a recent\\nreform, however, for it was just the other way, up to a few years ago--a\\nreform resulting from the lesson taught by a desolating visitation\\nof the yellow-fever. In those awful days the people were swept off by\\nhundreds, by thousands; and so great was the reduction caused by flight\\nand by death together, that the population was diminished three-fourths,\\nand so remained for a time. Business stood nearly still, and the streets\\nbore an empty Sunday aspect.\\n\\nHere is a picture of Memphis, at that disastrous time, drawn by a German\\ntourist who seems to have been an eye-witness of the scenes which he\\ndescribes. It is from Chapter VII, of his book, just published, in\\nLeipzig, 'Mississippi-Fahrten, von Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg.'--\\n\\n'In August the yellow-fever had reached its extremest height. Daily,\\nhundreds fell a sacrifice to the terrible epidemic. The city was become\\na mighty graveyard, two-thirds of the population had deserted the place,\\nand only the poor, the aged and the sick, remained behind, a sure prey\\nfor the insidious enemy. The houses were closed: little lamps burned in\\nfront of many--a sign that here death had entered. Often, several lay\\ndead in a single house; from the windows hung black crape. The stores\\nwere shut up, for their owners were gone away or dead.\\n\\n'Fearful evil! In the briefest space it struck down and swept away even\\nthe most vigorous victim. A slight indisposition, then an hour of\\nfever, then the hideous delirium, then--the Yellow Death! On the street\\ncorners, and in the squares, lay sick men, suddenly overtaken by the\\ndisease; and even corpses, distorted and rigid. Food failed. Meat\\nspoiled in a few hours in the fetid and pestiferous air, and turned\\nblack.\\n\\n'Fearful clamors issue from many houses; then after a season they cease,\\nand all is still: noble, self-sacrificing men come with the coffin,\\nnail it up, and carry it away, to the graveyard. In the night stillness\\nreigns. Only the physicians and the hearses hurry through the streets;\\nand out of the distance, at intervals, comes the muffled thunder of the\\nrailway train, which with the speed of the wind, and as if hunted by\\nfuries, flies by the pest-ridden city without halting.'\\n\\nBut there is life enough there now. The population exceeds forty\\nthousand and is augmenting, and trade is in a flourishing condition.\\nWe drove about the city; visited the park and the sociable horde of\\nsquirrels there; saw the fine residences, rose-clad and in other ways\\nenticing to the eye; and got a good breakfast at the hotel.\\n\\nA thriving place is the Good Samaritan City of the Mississippi: has\\na great wholesale jobbing trade; foundries, machine shops; and\\nmanufactories of wagons, carriages, and cotton-seed oil; and is shortly\\nto have cotton mills and elevators.\\n\\nHer cotton receipts reached five hundred thousand bales last year--an\\nincrease of sixty thousand over the year before. Out from her healthy\\ncommercial heart issue five trunk lines of railway; and a sixth is being\\nadded.\\n\\nThis is a very different Memphis from the one which the vanished and\\nunremembered procession of foreign tourists used to put into their books\\nlong time ago. In the days of the now forgotten but once renowned and\\nvigorously hated Mrs. Trollope, Memphis seems to have consisted mainly\\nof one long street of log-houses, with some outlying cabins sprinkled\\naround rearward toward the woods; and now and then a pig, and no end of\\nmud. That was fifty-five years ago. She stopped at the hotel. Plainly it\\nwas not the one which gave us our breakfast. She says--\\n\\n'The table was laid for fifty persons, and was nearly full. They ate in\\nperfect silence, and with such astonishing rapidity that their dinner\\nwas over literally before ours was begun; the only sounds heard were\\nthose produced by the knives and forks, with the unceasing chorus of\\ncoughing, _etc_.'\\n\\n'Coughing, etc.' The 'etc.' stands for an unpleasant word there, a word\\nwhich she does not always charitably cover up, but sometimes prints. You\\nwill find it in the following description of a steamboat dinner which\\nshe ate in company with a lot of aristocratic planters; wealthy,\\nwell-born, ignorant swells they were, tinselled with the usual harmless\\nmilitary and judicial titles of that old day of cheap shams and windy\\npretense--\\n\\n'The total want of all the usual courtesies of the table; the voracious\\nrapidity with which the viands were seized and devoured; the strange\\nuncouth phrases and pronunciation; the loathsome spitting, from the\\ncontamination of which it was absolutely impossible to protect our\\ndresses; the frightful manner of feeding with their knives, till the\\nwhole blade seemed to enter into the mouth; and the still more frightful\\nmanner of cleaning the teeth afterward with a pocket knife, soon forced\\nus to feel that we were not surrounded by the generals, colonels, and\\nmajors of the old world; and that the dinner hour was to be anything\\nrather than an hour of enjoyment.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 30\\n\\nSketches by the Way\\n\\nIT was a big river, below Memphis; banks brimming full, everywhere, and\\nvery frequently more than full, the waters pouring out over the land,\\nflooding the woods and fields for miles into the interior; and in\\nplaces, to a depth of fifteen feet; signs, all about, of men's hard work\\ngone to ruin, and all to be done over again, with straitened means and a\\nweakened courage. A melancholy picture, and a continuous one;--hundreds\\nof miles of it. Sometimes the beacon lights stood in water three feet\\ndeep, in the edge of dense forests which extended for miles without\\nfarm, wood-yard, clearing, or break of any kind; which meant that the\\nkeeper of the light must come in a skiff a great distance to discharge\\nhis trust,--and often in desperate weather. Yet I was told that the\\nwork is faithfully performed, in all weathers; and not always by\\nmen, sometimes by women, if the man is sick or absent. The Government\\nfurnishes oil, and pays ten or fifteen dollars a month for the lighting\\nand tending. A Government boat distributes oil and pays wages once a\\nmonth.\\n\\nThe Ship Island region was as woodsy and tenantless as ever. The island\\nhas ceased to be an island; has joined itself compactly to the main\\nshore, and wagons travel, now, where the steamboats used to navigate. No\\nsigns left of the wreck of the 'Pennsylvania.' Some farmer will turn up\\nher bones with his plow one day, no doubt, and be surprised.\\n\\nWe were getting down now into the migrating negro region. These poor\\npeople could never travel when they were slaves; so they make up for\\nthe privation now. They stay on a plantation till the desire to travel\\nseizes them; then they pack up, hail a steamboat, and clear out. Not for\\nany particular place; no, nearly any place will answer; they only want\\nto be moving. The amount of money on hand will answer the rest of the\\nconundrum for them. If it will take them fifty miles, very well; let it\\nbe fifty. If not, a shorter flight will do.\\n\\nDuring a couple of days, we frequently answered these hails. Sometimes\\nthere was a group of high-water-stained, tumble-down cabins, populous\\nwith colored folk, and no whites visible; with grassless patches of dry\\nground here and there; a few felled trees, with skeleton cattle, mules,\\nand horses, eating the leaves and gnawing the bark--no other food for\\nthem in the flood-wasted land. Sometimes there was a single lonely\\nlanding-cabin; near it the colored family that had hailed us; little and\\nbig, old and young, roosting on the scant pile of household goods; these\\nconsisting of a rusty gun, some bed-ticks, chests, tinware, stools,\\na crippled looking-glass, a venerable arm-chair, and six or eight\\nbase-born and spiritless yellow curs, attached to the family by strings.\\nThey must have their dogs; can't go without their dogs. Yet the dogs are\\nnever willing; they always object; so, one after another, in ridiculous\\nprocession, they are dragged aboard; all four feet braced and sliding\\nalong the stage, head likely to be pulled off; but the tugger marching\\ndeterminedly forward, bending to his work, with the rope over his\\nshoulder for better purchase. Sometimes a child is forgotten and left on\\nthe bank; but never a dog.\\n\\nThe usual river-gossip going on in the pilot-house. Island No. 63--an\\nisland with a lovely 'chute,' or passage, behind it in the former times.\\nThey said Jesse Jamieson, in the 'Skylark,' had a visiting pilot with\\nhim one trip--a poor old broken-down, superannuated fellow--left him at\\nthe wheel, at the foot of 63, to run off the watch. The ancient mariner\\nwent up through the chute, and down the river outside; and up the chute\\nand down the river again; and yet again and again; and handed the\\nboat over to the relieving pilot, at the end of three hours of honest\\nendeavor, at the same old foot of the island where he had originally\\ntaken the wheel! A darkey on shore who had observed the boat go by,\\nabout thirteen times, said, 'clar to gracious, I wouldn't be s'prised if\\ndey's a whole line o' dem Sk'ylarks!'\\n\\nAnecdote illustrative of influence of reputation in the changing of\\nopinion. The 'Eclipse' was renowned for her swiftness. One day she\\npassed along; an old darkey on shore, absorbed in his own matters, did\\nnot notice what steamer it was. Presently someone asked--\\n\\n'Any boat gone up?'\\n\\n'Yes, sah.'\\n\\n'Was she going fast?'\\n\\n'Oh, so-so--loafin' along.'\\n\\n'Now, do you know what boat that was?'\\n\\n'No, sah.'\\n\\n'Why, uncle, that was the “Eclipse.”'\\n\\n'No! Is dat so? Well, I bet it was--cause she jes' went by here\\na-_sparklin_'!'\\n\\nPiece of history illustrative of the violent style of some of the people\\ndown along here, During the early weeks of high water, A's fence rails\\nwashed down on B's ground, and B's rails washed up in the eddy and\\nlanded on A's ground. A said, 'Let the thing remain so; I will use your\\nrails, and you use mine.' But B objected--wouldn't have it so. One day,\\nA came down on B's ground to get his rails. B said, 'I'll kill you!' and\\nproceeded for him with his revolver. A said, 'I'm not armed.' So B, who\\nwished to do only what was right, threw down his revolver; then pulled\\na knife, and cut A's throat all around, but gave his principal attention\\nto the front, and so failed to sever the jugular. Struggling around, A\\nmanaged to get his hands on the discarded revolver, and shot B dead with\\nit--and recovered from his own injuries.\\n\\nFurther gossip;--after which, everybody went below to get afternoon\\ncoffee, and left me at the wheel, alone, Something presently reminded\\nme of our last hour in St. Louis, part of which I spent on this boat's\\nhurricane deck, aft. I was joined there by a stranger, who dropped into\\nconversation with me--a brisk young fellow, who said he was born in a\\ntown in the interior of Wisconsin, and had never seen a steamboat until\\na week before. Also said that on the way down from La Crosse he had\\ninspected and examined his boat so diligently and with such passionate\\ninterest that he had mastered the whole thing from stem to rudder-blade.\\nAsked me where I was from. I answered, New England. 'Oh, a Yank!' said\\nhe; and went chatting straight along, without waiting for assent or\\ndenial. He immediately proposed to take me all over the boat and tell\\nme the names of her different parts, and teach me their uses. Before I\\ncould enter protest or excuse, he was already rattling glibly away at\\nhis benevolent work; and when I perceived that he was misnaming the\\nthings, and inhospitably amusing himself at the expense of an innocent\\nstranger from a far country, I held my peace, and let him have his way.\\nHe gave me a world of misinformation; and the further he went, the wider\\nhis imagination expanded, and the more he enjoyed his cruel work of\\ndeceit. Sometimes, after palming off a particularly fantastic and\\noutrageous lie upon me, he was so 'full of laugh' that he had to\\nstep aside for a minute, upon one pretext or another, to keep me from\\nsuspecting. I staid faithfully by him until his comedy was finished.\\nThen he remarked that he had undertaken to 'learn' me all about a\\nsteamboat, and had done it; but that if he had overlooked anything, just\\nask him and he would supply the lack. 'Anything about this boat that you\\ndon't know the name of or the purpose of, you come to me and I'll tell\\nyou.' I said I would, and took my departure; disappeared, and approached\\nhim from another quarter, whence he could not see me. There he sat, all\\nalone, doubling himself up and writhing this way and that, in the throes\\nof unappeasable laughter. He must have made himself sick; for he was\\nnot publicly visible afterward for several days. Meantime, the episode\\ndropped out of my mind.\\n\\nThe thing that reminded me of it now, when I was alone at the wheel,\\nwas the spectacle of this young fellow standing in the pilot-house door,\\nwith the knob in his hand, silently and severely inspecting me. I don't\\nknow when I have seen anybody look so injured as he did. He did not\\nsay anything--simply stood there and looked; reproachfully looked and\\npondered. Finally he shut the door, and started away; halted on the\\ntexas a minute; came slowly back and stood in the door again, with that\\ngrieved look in his face; gazed upon me awhile in meek rebuke, then\\nsaid--\\n\\n'You let me learn you all about a steamboat, didn't you?'\\n\\n'Yes,' I confessed.\\n\\n'Yes, you did--_didn't_ you?'\\n\\n'Yes.'\\n\\n'You are the feller that--that--'\\n\\nLanguage failed. Pause--impotent struggle for further words--then he\\ngave it up, choked out a deep, strong oath, and departed for good.\\nAfterward I saw him several times below during the trip; but he was\\ncold--would not look at me. Idiot, if he had not been in such a sweat to\\nplay his witless practical joke upon me, in the beginning, I would have\\npersuaded his thoughts into some other direction, and saved him from\\ncommitting that wanton and silly impoliteness.\\n\\nI had myself called with the four o'clock watch, mornings, for one\\ncannot see too many summer sunrises on the Mississippi. They are\\nenchanting. First, there is the eloquence of silence; for a deep hush\\nbroods everywhere. Next, there is the haunting sense of loneliness,\\nisolation, remoteness from the worry and bustle of the world. The dawn\\ncreeps in stealthily; the solid walls of black forest soften to gray,\\nand vast stretches of the river open up and reveal themselves; the water\\nis glass-smooth, gives off spectral little wreaths of white mist, there\\nis not the faintest breath of wind, nor stir of leaf; the tranquillity\\nis profound and infinitely satisfying. Then a bird pipes up, another\\nfollows, and soon the pipings develop into a jubilant riot of music.\\nYou see none of the birds; you simply move through an atmosphere of song\\nwhich seems to sing itself. When the light has become a little stronger,\\nyou have one of the fairest and softest pictures imaginable. You have\\nthe intense green of the massed and crowded foliage near by; you see it\\npaling shade by shade in front of you; upon the next projecting cape,\\na mile off or more, the tint has lightened to the tender young green of\\nspring; the cape beyond that one has almost lost color, and the furthest\\none, miles away under the horizon, sleeps upon the water a mere dim\\nvapor, and hardly separable from the sky above it and about it. And all\\nthis stretch of river is a mirror, and you have the shadowy reflections\\nof the leafage and the curving shores and the receding capes pictured in\\nit. Well, that is all beautiful; soft and rich and beautiful; and when\\nthe sun gets well up, and distributes a pink flush here and a powder of\\ngold yonder and a purple haze where it will yield the best effect, you\\ngrant that you have seen something that is worth remembering.\\n\\nWe had the Kentucky Bend country in the early morning--scene of a\\nstrange and tragic accident in the old times, Captain Poe had a small\\nstern-wheel boat, for years the home of himself and his wife. One night\\nthe boat struck a snag in the head of Kentucky Bend, and sank with\\nastonishing suddenness; water already well above the cabin floor when\\nthe captain got aft. So he cut into his wife's state-room from above\\nwith an ax; she was asleep in the upper berth, the roof a flimsier one\\nthan was supposed; the first blow crashed down through the rotten boards\\nand clove her skull.\\n\\nThis bend is all filled up now--result of a cut-off; and the same agent\\nhas taken the great and once much-frequented Walnut Bend, and set\\nit away back in a solitude far from the accustomed track of passing\\nsteamers.\\n\\nHelena we visited, and also a town I had not heard of before, it being\\nof recent birth--Arkansas City. It was born of a railway; the Little\\nRock, Mississippi River and Texas Railroad touches the river there.\\nWe asked a passenger who belonged there what sort of a place it was.\\n'Well,' said he, after considering, and with the air of one who wishes\\nto take time and be accurate, 'It's a hell of a place.' A description\\nwhich was photographic for exactness. There were several rows and\\nclusters of shabby frame-houses, and a supply of mud sufficient to\\ninsure the town against a famine in that article for a hundred years;\\nfor the overflow had but lately subsided. There were stagnant ponds\\nin the streets, here and there, and a dozen rude scows were scattered\\nabout, lying aground wherever they happened to have been when the waters\\ndrained off and people could do their visiting and shopping on foot once\\nmore. Still, it is a thriving place, with a rich country behind it, an\\nelevator in front of it, and also a fine big mill for the manufacture of\\ncotton-seed oil. I had never seen this kind of a mill before.\\n\\nCotton-seed was comparatively valueless in my time; but it is worth $12\\nor $13 a ton now, and none of it is thrown away. The oil made from it is\\ncolorless, tasteless, and almost if not entirely odorless. It is claimed\\nthat it can, by proper manipulation, be made to resemble and perform the\\noffice of any and all oils, and be produced at a cheaper rate than\\nthe cheapest of the originals. Sagacious people shipped it to Italy,\\ndoctored it, labeled it, and brought it back as olive oil. This trade\\ngrew to be so formidable that Italy was obliged to put a prohibitory\\nimpost upon it to keep it from working serious injury to her oil\\nindustry.\\n\\nHelena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the Mississippi. Her\\nperch is the last, the southernmost group of hills which one sees on\\nthat side of the river. In its normal condition it is a pretty town; but\\nthe flood (or possibly the seepage) had lately been ravaging it; whole\\nstreets of houses had been invaded by the muddy water, and the outsides\\nof the buildings were still belted with a broad stain extending upwards\\nfrom the foundations. Stranded and discarded scows lay all about;\\nplank sidewalks on stilts four feet high were still standing; the board\\nsidewalks on the ground level were loose and ruinous,--a couple of men\\ntrotting along them could make a blind man think a cavalry charge\\nwas coming; everywhere the mud was black and deep, and in many\\nplaces malarious pools of stagnant water were standing. A Mississippi\\ninundation is the next most wasting and desolating infliction to a fire.\\n\\nWe had an enjoyable time here, on this sunny Sunday: two full hours'\\nliberty ashore while the boat discharged freight. In the back streets\\nbut few white people were visible, but there were plenty of colored\\nfolk--mainly women and girls; and almost without exception upholstered\\nin bright new clothes of swell and elaborate style and cut--a glaring\\nand hilarious contrast to the mournful mud and the pensive puddles.\\n\\nHelena is the second town in Arkansas, in point of population--which\\nis placed at five thousand. The country about it is exceptionally\\nproductive.

So I began to think about my\\nerrand there. Time, noonday; and bright and sunny. This was bad--not\\nbest, anyway; for mine was not (preferably) a noonday kind of errand.\\nThe more I thought, the more that fact pushed itself upon me--now in one\\nform, now in another. Finally, it took the form of a distinct question:\\nis it good common sense to do the errand in daytime, when, by a little\\nsacrifice of comfort and inclination, you can have night for it, and\\nno inquisitive eyes around. This settled it. Plain question and plain\\nanswer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.\\n\\nI got my friends into my stateroom, and said I was sorry to create\\nannoyance and disappointment, but that upon reflection it really seemed\\nbest that we put our luggage ashore and stop over at Napoleon. Their\\ndisapproval was prompt and loud; their language mutinous. Their main\\nargument was one which has always been the first to come to the surface,\\nin such cases, since the beginning of time: 'But you decided and _agreed\\n_to stick to this boat, etc.; as if, having determined to do an unwise\\nthing, one is thereby bound to go ahead and make _two _unwise things of\\nit, by carrying out that determination.\\n\\nI tried various mollifying tactics upon them, with reasonably good\\nsuccess: under which encouragement, I increased my efforts; and, to show\\nthem that I had not created this annoying errand, and was in no way to\\nblame for it, I presently drifted into its history--substantially as\\nfollows:\\n\\nToward the end of last year, I spent a few months in Munich, Bavaria.\\nIn November I was living in Fraulein Dahlweiner's _pension_, 1a,\\nKarlstrasse; but my working quarters were a mile from there, in the\\nhouse of a widow who supported herself by taking lodgers. She and her\\ntwo young children used to drop in every morning and talk German to\\nme--by request. One day, during a ramble about the city, I visited one\\nof the two establishments where the Government keeps and watches corpses\\nuntil the doctors decide that they are permanently dead, and not in\\na trance state. It was a grisly place, that spacious room. There were\\nthirty-six corpses of adults in sight, stretched on their backs on\\nslightly slanted boards, in three long rows--all of them with wax-white,\\nrigid faces, and all of them wrapped in white shrouds. Along the sides\\nof the room were deep alcoves, like bay windows; and in each of these\\nlay several marble-visaged babes, utterly hidden and buried under banks\\nof fresh flowers, all but their faces and crossed hands. Around a finger\\nof each of these fifty still forms, both great and small, was a ring;\\nand from the ring a wire led to the ceiling, and thence to a bell in a\\nwatch-room yonder, where, day and night, a watchman sits always alert\\nand ready to spring to the aid of any of that pallid company who,\\nwaking out of death, shall make a movement--for any, even the slightest,\\nmovement will twitch the wire and ring that fearful bell. I imagined\\nmyself a death-sentinel drowsing there alone, far in the dragging\\nwatches of some wailing, gusty night, and having in a twinkling all\\nmy body stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden clamor of that awful\\nsummons! So I inquired about this thing; asked what resulted usually? if\\nthe watchman died, and the restored corpse came and did what it could to\\nmake his last moments easy. But I was rebuked for trying to feed an idle\\nand frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a place; and went\\nmy way with a humbled crest.\\n\\nNext morning I was telling the widow my adventure, when she exclaimed--\\n\\n'Come with me! I have a lodger who shall tell you all you want to know.\\nHe has been a night-watchman there.'\\n\\nHe was a living man, but he did not look it. He was abed, and had his\\nhead propped high on pillows; his face was wasted and colorless,\\nhis deep-sunken eyes were shut; his hand, lying on his breast, was\\ntalon-like, it was so bony and long-fingered. The widow began her\\nintroduction of me. The man's eyes opened slowly, and glittered wickedly\\nout from the twilight of their caverns; he frowned a black frown; he\\nlifted his lean hand and waved us peremptorily away. But the widow kept\\nstraight on, till she had got out the fact that I was a stranger and\\nan American. The man's face changed at once; brightened, became even\\neager--and the next moment he and I were alone together.\\n\\nI opened up in cast-iron German; he responded in quite flexible English;\\nthereafter we gave the German language a permanent rest.\\n\\nThis consumptive and I became good friends. I visited him every day,\\nand we talked about everything. At least, about everything but wives and\\nchildren. Let anybody's wife or anybody's child be mentioned, and three\\nthings always followed: the most gracious and loving and tender light\\nglimmered in the man's eyes for a moment; faded out the next, and in its\\nplace came that deadly look which had flamed there the first time I ever\\nsaw his lids unclose; thirdly, he ceased from speech, there and then for\\nthat day; lay silent, abstracted, and absorbed; apparently heard nothing\\nthat I said; took no notice of my good-byes, and plainly did not know,\\nby either sight or hearing, when I left the room.\\n\\nWhen I had been this Karl Ritter's daily and sole intimate during two\\nmonths, he one day said, abruptly--\\n\\n'I will tell you my story.'\\n\\nA DYING MAN S CONFESSION\\n\\nThen he went on as follows:--\\n\\nI have never given up, until now. But now I have given up. I am going to\\ndie. I made up my mind last night that it must be, and very soon, too.\\nYou say you are going to revisit your river, by-and-bye, when you find\\nopportunity. Very well; that, together with a certain strange\\nexperience which fell to my lot last night, determines me to tell you my\\nhistory--for you will see Napoleon, Arkansas; and for my sake you\\nwill stop there, and do a certain thing for me--a thing which you will\\nwillingly undertake after you shall have heard my narrative.\\n\\nLet us shorten the story wherever we can, for it will need it, being\\nlong. You already know how I came to go to America, and how I came to\\nsettle in that lonely region in the South. But you do not know that I\\nhad a wife. My wife was young, beautiful, loving, and oh, so divinely\\ngood and blameless and gentle! And our little girl was her mother in\\nminiature. It was the happiest of happy households.\\n\\nOne night--it was toward the close of the war--I woke up out of a sodden\\nlethargy, and found myself bound and gagged, and the air tainted with\\nchloroform! I saw two men in the room, and one was saying to the other,\\nin a hoarse whisper, 'I told her I would, if she made a noise, and as\\nfor the child--'\\n\\nThe other man interrupted in a low, half-crying voice--\\n\\n'You said we'd only gag them and rob them, not hurt them; or I wouldn't\\nhave come.'\\n\\n'Shut up your whining; had to change the plan when they waked up; you\\ndone all you could to protect them, now let that satisfy you; come, help\\nrummage.'\\n\\nBoth men were masked, and wore coarse, ragged 'nigger' clothes; they had\\na bull's-eye lantern, and by its light I noticed that the gentler robber\\nhad no thumb on his right hand. They rummaged around my poor cabin for a\\nmoment; the head bandit then said, in his stage whisper--\\n\\n'It's a waste of time--he shall tell where it's hid. Undo his gag, and\\nrevive him up.'\\n\\nThe other said--\\n\\n'All right--provided no clubbing.'\\n\\n'No clubbing it is, then--provided he keeps still.'\\n\\nThey approached me; just then there was a sound outside; a sound of\\nvoices and trampling hoofs; the robbers held their breath and listened;\\nthe sounds came slowly nearer and nearer; then came a shout--\\n\\n'_Hello_, the house! Show a light, we want water.'\\n\\n'The captain's voice, by G--!' said the stage-whispering ruffian,\\nand both robbers fled by the way of the back door, shutting off their\\nbull's-eye as they ran.\\n\\nThe strangers shouted several times more, then rode by--there seemed to\\nbe a dozen of the horses--and I heard nothing more.\\n\\nI struggled, but could not free myself from my bonds. I tried to speak,\\nbut the gag was effective; I could not make a sound. I listened for my\\nwife's voice and my child's--listened long and intently, but no sound\\ncame from the other end of the room where their bed was. This silence\\nbecame more and more awful, more and more ominous, every moment. Could\\nyou have endured an hour of it, do you think? Pity me, then, who had\\nto endure three. Three hours--? it was three ages! Whenever the clock\\nstruck, it seemed as if years had gone by since I had heard it last. All\\nthis time I was struggling in my bonds; and at last, about dawn, I got\\nmyself free, and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs. I was able to\\ndistinguish details pretty well. The floor was littered with things\\nthrown there by the robbers during their search for my savings. The\\nfirst object that caught my particular attention was a document of mine\\nwhich I had seen the rougher of the two ruffians glance at and then cast\\naway. It had blood on it! I staggered to the other end of the room. Oh,\\npoor unoffending, helpless ones, there they lay, their troubles ended,\\nmine begun!\\n\\nDid I appeal to the law--I? Does it quench the pauper's thirst if the\\nKing drink for him? Oh, no, no, no--I wanted no impertinent interference\\nof the law. Laws and the gallows could not pay the debt that was owing\\nto me! Let the laws leave the matter in my hands, and have no fears: I\\nwould find the debtor and collect the debt. How accomplish this, do you\\nsay? How accomplish it, and feel so sure about it, when I had neither\\nseen the robbers' faces, nor heard their natural voices, nor had any\\nidea who they might be? Nevertheless, I _was _sure--quite sure, quite\\nconfident. I had a clue--a clue which you would not have valued--a clue\\nwhich would not have greatly helped even a detective, since he would\\nlack the secret of how to apply it. I shall come to that, presently--you\\nshall see. Let us go on, now, taking things in their due order. There\\nwas one circumstance which gave me a slant in a definite direction\\nto begin with: Those two robbers were manifestly soldiers in tramp\\ndisguise; and not new to military service, but old in it--regulars,\\nperhaps; they did not acquire their soldierly attitude, gestures,\\ncarriage, in a day, nor a month, nor yet in a year. So I thought,\\nbut said nothing. And one of them had said, 'the captain's voice,\\nby G--!'--the one whose life I would have. Two miles away, several\\nregiments were in camp, and two companies of U.S. cavalry. When I\\nlearned that Captain Blakely, of Company C had passed our way, that\\nnight, with an escort, I said nothing, but in that company I resolved to\\nseek my man. In conversation I studiously and persistently described the\\nrobbers as tramps, camp followers; and among this class the people made\\nuseless search, none suspecting the soldiers but me.\\n\\nWorking patiently, by night, in my desolated home, I made a disguise for\\nmyself out of various odds and ends of clothing; in the nearest village\\nI bought a pair of blue goggles. By-and-bye, when the military camp\\nbroke up, and Company C was ordered a hundred miles north, to Napoleon,\\nI secreted my small hoard of money in my belt, and took my departure in\\nthe night. When Company C arrived in Napoleon, I was already there. Yes,\\nI was there, with a new trade--fortune-teller. Not to seem partial, I\\nmade friends and told fortunes among all the companies garrisoned there;\\nbut I gave Company C the great bulk of my attentions. I made myself\\nlimitlessly obliging to these particular men; they could ask me no\\nfavor, put upon me no risk, which I would decline. I became the willing\\nbutt of their jokes; this perfected my popularity; I became a favorite.\\n\\nI early found a private who lacked a thumb--what joy it was to me! And\\nwhen I found that he alone, of all the company, had lost a thumb, my\\nlast misgiving vanished; I was _sure _I was on the right track. This\\nman's name was Kruger, a German. There were nine Germans in the company.\\nI watched, to see who might be his intimates; but he seemed to have no\\nespecial intimates. But I was his intimate; and I took care to make\\nthe intimacy grow. Sometimes I so hungered for my revenge that I could\\nhardly restrain myself from going on my knees and begging him to point\\nout the man who had murdered my wife and child; but I managed to bridle\\nmy tongue. I bided my time, and went on telling fortunes, as opportunity\\noffered.\\n\\nMy apparatus was simple: a little red paint and a bit of white paper. I\\npainted the ball of the client's thumb, took a print of it on the paper,\\nstudied it that night, and revealed his fortune to him next day. What\\nwas my idea in this nonsense? It was this: When I was a youth, I knew an\\nold Frenchman who had been a prison-keeper for thirty years, and he told\\nme that there was one thing about a person which never changed, from\\nthe cradle to the grave--the lines in the ball of the thumb; and he said\\nthat these lines were never exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human\\nbeings. In these days, we photograph the new criminal, and hang his\\npicture in the Rogues' Gallery for future reference; but that Frenchman,\\nin his day, used to take a print of the ball of a new prisoner's thumb\\nand put that away for future reference. He always said that pictures\\nwere no good--future disguises could make them useless; 'The thumb's\\nthe only sure thing,' said he; 'you can't disguise that.' And he used\\nto prove his theory, too, on my friends and acquaintances; it always\\nsucceeded.\\n\\nI went on telling fortunes. Every night I shut myself in, all alone,\\nand studied the day's thumb-prints with a magnifying-glass. Imagine the\\ndevouring eagerness with which I pored over those mazy red spirals,\\nwith that document by my side which bore the right-hand\\nthumb-and-finger-marks of that unknown murderer, printed with the\\ndearest blood--to me--that was ever shed on this earth! And many and\\nmany a time I had to repeat the same old disappointed remark, 'will they\\n_never _correspond!'\\n\\nBut my reward came at last. It was the print of the thumb of the\\nforty-third man of Company C whom I had experimented on--Private Franz\\nAdler. An hour before, I did not know the murderer's name, or voice,\\nor figure, or face, or nationality; but now I knew all these things!\\nI believed I might feel sure; the Frenchman's repeated demonstrations\\nbeing so good a warranty. Still, there was a way to _make _sure. I had\\nan impression of Kruger's left thumb. In the morning I took him aside\\nwhen he was off duty; and when we were out of sight and hearing of\\nwitnesses, I said, impressively--\\n\\n'A part of your fortune is so grave, that I thought it would be better\\nfor you if I did not tell it in public. You and another man, whose\\nfortune I was studying last night,--Private Adler,--have been murdering\\na woman and a child! You are being dogged: within five days both of you\\nwill be assassinated.'\\n\\nHe dropped on his knees, frightened out of his wits; and for five\\nminutes he kept pouring out the same set of words, like a demented\\nperson, and in the same half-crying way which was one of my memories of\\nthat murderous night in my cabin--\\n\\n'I didn't do it; upon my soul I didn't do it; and I tried to keep _him\\n_from doing it; I did, as God is my witness. He did it alone.'\\n\\nThis was all I wanted. And I tried to get rid of the fool; but no, he\\nclung to me, imploring me to save him from the assassin. He said--\\n\\n'I have money--ten thousand dollars--hid away, the fruit of loot and\\nthievery; save me--tell me what to do, and you shall have it, every\\npenny. Two-thirds of it is my cousin Adler's; but you can take it\\nall. We hid it when we first came here. But I hid it in a new place\\nyesterday, and have not told him--shall not tell him. I was going to\\ndesert, and get away with it all. It is gold, and too heavy to carry\\nwhen one is running and dodging; but a woman who has been gone over the\\nriver two days to prepare my way for me is going to follow me with it;\\nand if I got no chance to describe the hiding-place to her I was going\\nto slip my silver watch into her hand, or send it to her, and she would\\nunderstand. There's a piece of paper in the back of the case, which\\ntells it all. Here, take the watch--tell me what to do!'\\n\\nHe was trying to press his watch upon me, and was exposing the paper\\nand explaining it to me, when Adler appeared on the scene, about a dozen\\nyards away. I said to poor Kruger--\\n\\n'Put up your watch, I don't want it. You shan't come to any harm. Go,\\nnow; I must tell Adler his fortune. Presently I will tell you how to\\nescape the assassin; meantime I shall have to examine your thumbmark\\nagain. Say nothing to Adler about this thing--say nothing to anybody.'\\n\\nHe went away filled with fright and gratitude, poor devil. I told Adler\\na long fortune--purposely so long that I could not finish it; promised\\nto come to him on guard, that night, and tell him the really important\\npart of it--the tragical part of it, I said--so must be out of reach of\\neavesdroppers. They always kept a picket-watch outside the town--mere\\ndiscipline and ceremony--no occasion for it, no enemy around.\\n\\nToward midnight I set out, equipped with the countersign, and picked my\\nway toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep his watch. It was\\nso dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure almost before I could get\\nout a protecting word. The sentinel hailed and I answered, both at the\\nsame moment. I added, 'It's only me--the fortune-teller.' Then I slipped\\nto the poor devil's side, and without a word I drove my dirk into his\\nheart! _Ya wohl_, laughed I, it _was _the tragedy part of his fortune,\\nindeed! As he fell from his horse, he clutched at me, and my blue\\ngoggles remained in his hand; and away plunged the beast dragging him,\\nwith his foot in the stirrup.\\n\\nI fled through the woods, and made good my escape, leaving the accusing\\ngoggles behind me in that dead man's hand.\\n\\nThis was fifteen or sixteen years ago. Since then I have wandered\\naimlessly about the earth, sometimes at work, sometimes idle; sometimes\\nwith money, sometimes with none; but always tired of life, and wishing\\nit was done, for my mission here was finished, with the act of that\\nnight; and the only pleasure, solace, satisfaction I had, in all those\\ntedious years, was in the daily reflection, 'I have killed him!'\\n\\nFour years ago, my health began to fail. I had wandered into Munich, in\\nmy purposeless way. Being out of money, I sought work, and got it; did\\nmy duty faithfully about a year, and was then given the berth of night\\nwatchman yonder in that dead-house which you visited lately. The place\\nsuited my mood. I liked it. I liked being with the dead--liked being\\nalone with them. I used to wander among those rigid corpses, and peer\\ninto their austere faces, by the hour. The later the time, the more\\nimpressive it was; I preferred the late time. Sometimes I turned the\\nlights low: this gave perspective, you see; and the imagination could\\nplay; always, the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with weird\\nand fascinating fancies. Two years ago--I had been there a year then--I\\nwas sitting all alone in the watch-room, one gusty winter's night,\\nchilled, numb, comfortless; drowsing gradually into unconsciousness; the\\nsobbing of the wind and the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter\\nand fainter upon my dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly\\nthat dead-bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head! The shock\\nof it nearly paralyzed me; for it was the first time I had ever heard\\nit.\\n\\nI gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room. About midway\\ndown the outside rank, a shrouded figure was sitting upright, wagging\\nits head slowly from one side to the other--a grisly spectacle! Its side\\nwas toward me. I hurried to it and peered into its face. Heavens, it was\\nAdler!\\n\\nCan you divine what my first thought was? Put into words, it was this:\\n'It seems, then, you escaped me once: there will be a different result\\nthis time!'\\n\\nEvidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors. Think what\\nit must have been to wake up in the midst of that voiceless hush, and,\\nlook out over that grim congregation of the dead! What gratitude shone\\nin his skinny white face when he saw a living form before him! And how\\nthe fervency of this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell\\nupon the life-giving cordials which I carried in my hands! Then imagine\\nthe horror which came into this pinched face when I put the cordials\\nbehind me, and said mockingly--\\n\\n'Speak up, Franz Adler--call upon these dead. Doubtless they will listen\\nand have pity; but here there is none else that will.'\\n\\nHe tried to speak, but that part of the shroud which bound his jaws,\\nheld firm and would not let him. He tried to lift imploring hands, but\\nthey were crossed upon his breast and tied. I said--\\n\\n'Shout, Franz Adler; make the sleepers in the distant streets hear you\\nand bring help. Shout--and lose no time, for there is little to lose.\\nWhat, you cannot? That is a pity; but it is no matter--it does not\\nalways bring help. When you and your cousin murdered a helpless woman\\nand child in a cabin in Arkansas--my wife, it was, and my child!--they\\nshrieked for help, you remember; but it did no good; you remember that\\nit did no good, is it not so? Your teeth chatter--then why cannot\\nyou shout? Loosen the bandages with your hands--then you can. Ah, I\\nsee--your hands are tied, they cannot aid you. How strangely things\\nrepeat themselves, after long years; for _my_ hands were tied, that\\nnight, you remember? Yes, tied much as yours are now--how odd that is.\\nI could not pull free. It did not occur to you to untie me; it does not\\noccur to me to untie you. Sh--! there's a late footstep. It is\\ncoming this way. Hark, how near it is! One can count the\\nfootfalls--one--two--three. There--it is just outside. Now is the time!\\nShout, man, shout!--it is the one sole chance between you and eternity!\\nAh, you see you have delayed too long--it is gone by. There--it is dying\\nout. It is gone! Think of it--reflect upon it--you have heard a human\\nfootstep for the last time. How curious it must be, to listen to so\\ncommon a sound as that, and know that one will never hear the fellow to\\nit again.'\\n\\nOh, my friend, the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy to see! I\\nthought of a new torture, and applied it--assisting myself with a trifle\\nof lying invention--\\n\\n'That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child, and I did him a\\ngrateful good turn for it when the time came. I persuaded him to\\nrob you; and I and a woman helped him to desert, and got him away in\\nsafety.' A look as of surprise and triumph shone out dimly through the\\nanguish in my victim's face. I was disturbed, disquieted. I said--\\n\\n'What, then--didn't he escape?'\\n\\nA negative shake of the head.\\n\\n'No? What happened, then?'\\n\\nThe satisfaction in the shrouded face was still plainer. The man tried\\nto mumble out some words--could not succeed; tried to express something\\nwith his obstructed hands--failed; paused a moment, then feebly tilted\\nhis head, in a meaning way, toward the corpse that lay nearest him.\\n\\n'Dead?' I asked. 'Failed to escape?--caught in the act and shot?'\\n\\nNegative shake of the head.\\n\\n'How, then?'\\n\\nAgain the man tried to do something with his hands. I watched closely,\\nbut could not guess the intent. I bent over and watched still more\\nintently. He had twisted a thumb around and was weakly punching at his\\nbreast with it. 'Ah--stabbed, do you mean?'\\n\\nAffirmative nod, accompanied by a spectral smile of such peculiar\\ndevilishness, that it struck an awakening light through my dull brain,\\nand I cried--\\n\\n'Did I stab him, mistaking him for you?--for that stroke was meant for\\nnone but you.'\\n\\nThe affirmative nod of the re-dying rascal was as joyous as his failing\\nstrength was able to put into its expression.\\n\\n'O, miserable, miserable me, to slaughter the pitying soul that, stood a\\nfriend to my darlings when they were helpless, and would have saved them\\nif he could! miserable, oh, miserable, miserable me!'\\n\\nI fancied I heard the muffled gurgle of a mocking laugh. I took my face\\nout of my hands, and saw my enemy sinking back upon his inclined board.\\n\\nHe was a satisfactory long time dying. He had a wonderful vitality, an\\nastonishing constitution. Yes, he was a pleasant long time at it. I got\\na chair and a newspaper, and sat down by him and read. Occasionally I\\ntook a sip of brandy. This was necessary, on account of the cold. But I\\ndid it partly because I saw, that along at first, whenever I reached\\nfor the bottle, he thought I was going to give him some. I read aloud:\\nmainly imaginary accounts of people snatched from the grave's threshold\\nand restored to life and vigor by a few spoonsful of liquor and a warm\\nbath. Yes, he had a long, hard death of it--three hours and six minutes,\\nfrom the time he rang his bell.\\n\\nIt is believed that in all these eighteen years that have elapsed\\nsince the institution of the corpse-watch, no shrouded occupant of the\\nBavarian dead-houses has ever rung its bell. Well, it is a harmless\\nbelief. Let it stand at that.\\n\\nThe chill of that death-room had penetrated my bones. It revived and\\nfastened upon me the disease which had been afflicting me, but which, up\\nto that night, had been steadily disappearing. That man murdered my wife\\nand my child; and in three days hence he will have added me to his list.\\nNo matter--God! how delicious the memory of it!--I caught him escaping\\nfrom his grave, and thrust him back into it.\\n\\nAfter that night, I was confined to my bed for a week; but as soon as\\nI could get about, I went to the dead-house books and got the number of\\nthe house which Adler had died in. A wretched lodging-house, it was.\\nIt was my idea that he would naturally have gotten hold of Kruger's\\neffects, being his cousin; and I wanted to get Kruger's watch, if I\\ncould. But while I was sick, Adler's things had been sold and scattered,\\nall except a few old letters, and some odds and ends of no value.\\nHowever, through those letters, I traced out a son of Kruger's, the\\nonly relative left. He is a man of thirty now, a shoemaker by trade,\\nand living at No. 14 Konigstrasse, Mannheim--widower, with several small\\nchildren. Without explaining to him why, I have furnished two-thirds of\\nhis support, ever since.\\n\\nNow, as to that watch--see how strangely things happen! I traced it\\naround and about Germany for more than a year, at considerable cost in\\nmoney and vexation; and at last I got it. Got it, and was unspeakably\\nglad; opened it, and found nothing in it! Why, I might have known that\\nthat bit of paper was not going to stay there all this time. Of course\\nI gave up that ten thousand dollars then; gave it up, and dropped it out\\nof my mind: and most sorrowfully, for I had wanted it for Kruger's son.\\n\\nLast night, when I consented at last that I must die, I began to make\\nready. I proceeded to burn all useless papers; and sure enough, from a\\nbatch of Adler's, not previously examined with thoroughness, out dropped\\nthat long-desired scrap! I recognized it in a moment. Here it is--I will\\ntranslate it:\\n\\n'Brick livery stable, stone foundation, middle of town, corner of\\nOrleans and Market. Corner toward Court-house. Third stone, fourth row.\\nStick notice there, saying how many are to come.'\\n\\nThere--take it, and preserve it. Kruger explained that that stone was\\nremovable; and that it was in the north wall of the foundation, fourth\\nrow from the top, and third stone from the west. The money is secreted\\nbehind it. He said the closing sentence was a blind, to mislead in\\ncase the paper should fall into wrong hands. It probably performed that\\noffice for Adler.\\n\\nNow I want to beg that when you make your intended journey down the\\nriver, you will hunt out that hidden money, and send it to Adam Kruger,\\ncare of the Mannheim address which I have mentioned. It will make a rich\\nman of him, and I shall sleep the sounder in my grave for knowing that I\\nhave done what I could for the son of the man who tried to save my\\nwife and child--albeit my hand ignorantly struck him down, whereas the\\nimpulse of my heart would have been to shield and serve him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 32\\n\\nThe Disposal of a Bonanza\\n\\n'SUCH was Ritter's narrative,' said I to my two friends. There was a\\nprofound and impressive silence, which lasted a considerable time; then\\nboth men broke into a fusillade of exciting and admiring ejaculations\\nover the strange incidents of the tale; and this, along with a rattling\\nfire of questions, was kept up until all hands were about out of breath.\\nThen my friends began to cool down, and draw off, under shelter of\\noccasional volleys, into silence and abysmal reverie. For ten minutes\\nnow, there was stillness. Then Rogers said dreamily--\\n\\n'Ten thousand dollars.'\\n\\nAdding, after a considerable pause--\\n\\n'Ten thousand. It is a heap of money.'\\n\\nPresently the poet inquired--\\n\\n'Are you going to send it to him right away?'\\n\\n'Yes,' I said. 'It is a queer question.'\\n\\nNo reply. After a little, Rogers asked, hesitatingly:\\n\\n'_All _of it?--That is--I mean--'\\n\\n'Certainly, all of it.'\\n\\nI was going to say more, but stopped--was stopped by a train of thought\\nwhich started up in me. Thompson spoke, but my mind was absent, and I\\ndid not catch what he said. But I heard Rogers answer--\\n\\n'Yes, it seems so to me. It ought to be quite sufficient; for I don't\\nsee that he has done anything.'\\n\\nPresently the poet said--\\n\\n'When you come to look at it, it is more than sufficient. Just look at\\nit--five thousand dollars! Why, he couldn't spend it in a lifetime! And\\nit would injure him, too; perhaps ruin him--you want to look at that.\\nIn a little while he would throw his last away, shut up his shop, maybe\\ntake to drinking, maltreat his motherless children, drift into other\\nevil courses, go steadily from bad to worse--'\\n\\n'Yes, that's it,' interrupted Rogers, fervently, 'I've seen it a hundred\\ntimes--yes, more than a hundred. You put money into the hands of a man\\nlike that, if you want to destroy him, that's all; just put money into\\nhis hands, it's all you've got to do; and if it don't pull him down,\\nand take all the usefulness out of him, and all the self-respect and\\neverything, then I don't know human nature--ain't that so, Thompson?\\nAnd even if we were to give him a _third _of it; why, in less than six\\nmonths--'\\n\\n'Less than six _weeks_, you'd better say!' said I, warming up and\\nbreaking in. 'Unless he had that three thousand dollars in safe hands\\nwhere he couldn't touch it, he would no more last you six weeks than--'\\n\\n'Of _course _he wouldn't,' said Thompson; 'I've edited books for\\nthat kind of people; and the moment they get their hands on the\\nroyalty--maybe it's three thousand, maybe it's two thousand--'\\n\\n'What business has that shoemaker with two thousand dollars, I should\\nlike to know?' broke in Rogers, earnestly. 'A man perhaps perfectly\\ncontented now, there in Mannheim, surrounded by his own class, eating\\nhis bread with the appetite which laborious industry alone can\\ngive, enjoying his humble life, honest, upright, pure in heart; and\\n_blest_!--yes, I say blest! blest above all the myriads that go in silk\\nattire and walk the empty artificial round of social folly--but just\\nyou put that temptation before him once! just you lay fifteen hundred\\ndollars before a man like that, and say--'\\n\\n'Fifteen hundred devils!' cried I, '_five _hundred would rot his\\nprinciples, paralyze his industry, drag him to the rumshop, thence to\\nthe gutter, thence to the almshouse, thence to----'\\n\\n'_Why _put upon ourselves this crime, gentlemen?' interrupted the poet\\nearnestly and appealingly. 'He is happy where he is, and _as _he is.\\nEvery sentiment of honor, every sentiment of charity, every sentiment of\\nhigh and sacred benevolence warns us, beseeches us, commands us to leave\\nhim undisturbed. That is real friendship, that is true friendship. We\\ncould follow other courses that would be more showy; but none that would\\nbe so truly kind and wise, depend upon it.'\\n\\nAfter some further talk, it became evident that each of us, down in his\\nheart, felt some misgivings over this settlement of the matter. It\\nwas manifest that we all felt that we ought to send the poor shoemaker\\n_something_. There was long and thoughtful discussion of this point; and\\nwe finally decided to send him a chromo.\\n\\nWell, now that everything seemed to be arranged satisfactorily to\\neverybody concerned, a new trouble broke out: it transpired that these\\ntwo men were expecting to share equally in the money with me. That was\\nnot my idea. I said that if they got half of it between them they might\\nconsider themselves lucky. Rogers said--\\n\\n'Who would have had _any _if it hadn't been for me? I flung out the\\nfirst hint--but for that it would all have gone to the shoemaker.'\\n\\nThompson said that he was thinking of the thing himself at the very\\nmoment that Rogers had originally spoken.\\n\\nI retorted that the idea would have occurred to me plenty soon enough,\\nand without anybody's help. I was slow about thinking, maybe, but I was\\nsure.\\n\\nThis matter warmed up into a quarrel; then into a fight; and each man\\ngot pretty badly battered. As soon as I had got myself mended up after\\na fashion, I ascended to the hurricane deck in a pretty sour humor. I\\nfound Captain McCord there, and said, as pleasantly as my humor would\\npermit--\\n\\n'I have come to say good-bye, captain. I wish to go ashore at Napoleon.'\\n\\n'Go ashore where?'\\n\\n'Napoleon.'\\n\\nThe captain laughed; but seeing that I was not in a jovial mood, stopped\\nthat and said--\\n\\n'But are you serious?'\\n\\n'Serious? I certainly am.'\\n\\nThe captain glanced up at the pilot-house and said--\\n\\n'He wants to get off at Napoleon!'\\n\\n'Napoleon?'\\n\\n'That's what he says.'\\n\\n'Great Caesar's ghost!'\\n\\nUncle Mumford approached along the deck. The captain said--\\n\\n'Uncle, here's a friend of yours wants to get off at Napoleon!'\\n\\n'Well, by--?'\\n\\nI said--\\n\\n'Come, what is all this about? Can't a man go ashore at Napoleon if he\\nwants to?'\\n\\n'Why, hang it, don't you know? There _isn't_ any Napoleon any more.\\nHasn't been for years and years. The Arkansas River burst through it,\\ntore it all to rags, and emptied it into the Mississippi!'\\n\\n'Carried the _whole _town away?-banks, churches, jails,\\nnewspaper-offices, court-house, theater, fire department, livery stable\\n_everything _?'\\n\\n'Everything. just a fifteen-minute job.' or such a matter. Didn't leave\\nhide nor hair, shred nor shingle of it, except the fag-end of a shanty\\nand one brick chimney. This boat is paddling along right now, where the\\ndead-center of that town used to be; yonder is the brick chimney-all\\nthat's left of Napoleon. These dense woods on the right used to be a\\nmile back of the town. Take a look behind you--up-stream--now you begin\\nto recognize this country, don't you?'\\n\\n'Yes, I do recognize it now. It is the most wonderful thing I ever heard\\nof; by a long shot the most wonderful--and unexpected.'\\n\\nMr. Thompson and Mr. Rogers had arrived, meantime, with satchels and\\numbrellas, and had silently listened to the captain's news. Thompson put\\na half-dollar in my hand and said softly--\\n\\n'For my share of the chromo.'\\n\\nRogers followed suit.\\n\\nYes, it was an astonishing thing to see the Mississippi rolling between\\nunpeopled shores and straight over the spot where I used to see a good\\nbig self-complacent town twenty years ago. Town that was county-seat\\nof a great and important county; town with a big United States marine\\nhospital; town of innumerable fights--an inquest every day; town where\\nI had used to know the prettiest girl, and the most accomplished in the\\nwhole Mississippi Valley; town where we were handed the first printed\\nnews of the 'Pennsylvania's' mournful disaster a quarter of a century\\nago; a town no more--swallowed up, vanished, gone to feed the fishes;\\nnothing left but a fragment of a shanty and a crumbling brick chimney!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 33\\n\\nRefreshments and Ethi\""
